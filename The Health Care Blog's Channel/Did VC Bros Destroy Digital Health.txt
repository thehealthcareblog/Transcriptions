so welcome welcome welcome to our new episode of digital Health inside out just to remind you the goal of the show is to choose a specific topic obviously related to digital health and find the best experts to talk about it and hopefully to uncover it from different angles and perspectives so our first episode was related to um medical eii and how gen eii in general influenced um the house space to be fair it felt like we recorded like a year ago because so much happened since our previous episode it was still

recorded in the pre- deep pre- deep seek era uh open AI also released a new model since then so I feel like we do need to do a second part of that episode at some point soon um but today we're actually going to talk less about technology and more about money so the topic of our Today's Show is did VC br destroy digital health and I'm super delightful to introduce to you to our today's guests uh traditionally we have with us Sergey poo we also have James swen and one and only Matthew halt hello

gentlemen yeah let's start with our short intros uh I guess I I'll go first I'm Alex kosikov I I'm a co-founder of B A consulting firm um focused on building software hardware and solutions for healthcare um Sergey you want to go next yes hi my name is Sergey pikov um I am the co-founder of welli digital Health company and my background is math and um data science I also want to say that uh in my personal Journey I'm on a Road to Redemption and that's part of the reason I got involved in healthcare several

years ago and I just want to encourage everybody um you know uh to involve more people people into digital Health AI Healthcare there are a lot of problems to be solved and I think there are a lot of people like me who have done mistakes in the past but um you know want to make it right and not necessarily for the financial incentives thank you thank you James sure uh James Wang General partner at creative Ventures uh since 2016 we've been a uh early stage deep Tech investor so we done a lot in AI robotics

synthetic biology Advanced Materials uh but we've had a lot of uh companies within the health space and uh specifically though it's like for example portable ultrasound uh mems based Technologies uh cell avatars in terms of for uh for more specific cancer uh treatments and things like that less so digital Health admittedly uh but hopefully I can give some context on some of uh the VC side of things too previously corn team at Bridgewater Associates distant at Google X and at least my academic background is uh

statistical learning which then became machine learning which then became AI it's just the evolution over the years so very cool thank you I want to add that GS has a book coming up on artificial intelligence that's right Sergey I think is doing a better job at self-promotion than I am uh yes I have a book coming out uh what you need to know about AI uh planned for August of 2025 so please look out for it awesome yeah that's great looking forward to it and Matthew fantastic well I love the idea that uh we have uh you know the these

the non- self-promoting book author but you're a VC James so people need to find you anyway because you had the money and so is doing a great job of of of promoting yourself and himself and and you Alex too anyway so Matthew Hal uh old guy in health Tech I um don't have any academic background of any value you know I'm kidding I have a political science degree and a degree in Health Services Research so I don't understand AI math physics all that stuff is very very confusing to me um for many many

years 20 years I've been 25 years I've been uh writing a Blog called the healthcare blog which has looked PR predominately two areas one is um Health policy Health business how the healthc care system promly in America but occasionally elsewhere is developing and the other one is sort of the what's now called digital Health which used to be called uh Health 2.0

when I started pH phrasing actually it was called ealth before that um and I ran a conference for many years called Health 2.0 which featured a lot of that so I I've been kind of stuck in this weird way between weird position between being very cynical about the Health Care System um and the practices I mean it's kind of amusing to me that Sergey says he came to healthcare with some kind of redemption most F Healthcare need some Redemption about how the Healthcare System operates um but on the other hand hopeful that some of these new

technology companies we've seen coming into it would do something to to change it I'm getting more and more cynical about that part as well but I guess that'll be the focus of our discussion here but uh um and now I spend most of my time when I'm not sort of connected to my blog the media site and talking doing this kind of stuff helping early stage companies try to figure out how to meet VCS and raise money and get from sort of zero to one to two um and it's not easy all right thank you very much

so actually I want to start with giving you some data and I think lots of people in digital Health kind of already know this but still to remind you the total Venture funding in digital Health let's start with 2020 was $14.3 billion in 2021 it boomed and paked to$ 29.2 billion um decline to 15.7 in 2022 10.8 2023 

and we're almost got to that number in 2024 it's still a little smaller it's 10.1 billion but I do hear a lot of optimism regarding 2025 um we hopefully going to beat last year uh number and also there's definitely going to be more m&as happening and we actually already see that in 2025 some of the merges and acquisition happened in digital Health space so James let's start with you can you tell us what do you think how how the pandemic actually influenced the digital Health investment space and what what's what should we expect in the near

future yeah totally I mean that chart that you just talked about just in terms of the visual of the ramp and then crash uh actually parallels most startups so in terms of like startup financing and VC financing in terms of how much VC has got money uh there's a pretty big parallel where you have 2021 being kind of the uh big hype period and then 2022 essentially having that crash down especially as interest rates and everything we're going up so uh that part is similar however for digital Health I'd say it's bigger because

especially during early Co everyone was worried what's going to happen but by 2021 the idea was look all these RPM codes all this interesting stuff that must mean that digital health is going to go through a boom the entire Health Care system is changing so we should pour money into it uh 2022 with money a lot of money being pulled back and a lot of different digital Health companies not really doing as well basically pulled that back a lot lot and especially as the RPM codes started rolling off and other stuff uh that from

the FDA that also became just harder in terms of environment so we've kind of been in a winter ever since for uh the the area and public uh public like digital health and just healthc care stuff in general has been doing poorly 2025 is hard to say honestly because the issue is interest rates probably aren't going to come down this is my old uh macro uh hedge fund sort of hat uh talking about it uh so it's probably still kind of a wait and see uh one of the big catalysts for the private markets will still be like are we going

to see more exits we are seeing more exits uh maybe the new Administration that's the argument it's like maybe because of that there will be less anti-competition like things in terms of the FTC and stuff so maybe there's more Acquisitions and stuff too but I'd say we still have to more wait and see it's probably going to be better than last year but uh in terms of if there's going to be a boom again still to be to be determined yeah looks like with within your Administration most of the topics

we usually talk to everything ends up with we do not know what to expect uh craziness yeah we're seeing that already and expect some more of that for a while I think yeah true so Sergey a very simple question to you did VC Bros destroy digital I think the problem is and I've talked about it um a lot is that we have concentration of capital in a very few hands in digital health and unfortunately you know that concentration has not done well uh you know especially I'm looking at maybe last 10 15 years um there are certain

players that are dictating where money goes uh in my view it's a very close circle of people you know who gets the money who doesn't get the money unfortunately people who control the money have no clue how to pick winners and um as a result if you look at numbers very carefully you see that the VC back firm they've been losing money left and right and real innovators have been kind of on the sidelines that's been a problem in one of my latest research that I've done um I looked at public Trad companies I

identify 132 companies if you really go into the sourcing and you know who invested the money into those companies and essentially have two different stories if you look at VCB uh digital Health startups they lost about 70 billion in earnings over the last five years and bootst companies actually G not a lot so we're talking probably you know broken even um but that kind of shows that you know um even though we see those people at conferences and they all wear you know v-neck and whatever turtl NEX and seem

to be smart but um unfortunately numbers show the opposite but I think the biggest problem is the this um Brotherhood you know that um in my opinion it's a lot about who you know in this industry and if you don't know the right people even if if you have the best ideas you may not be able to implement those ideas and there arguments oh you know it's it's never been the case you're you're looking for outliers always and you know who who cares about the media but you know uh if you're talking

from a n location standpoint um you looking at venture capital and probably private Equity as a uh this illiquid asset class um and sort of by Theory but you know what we've learned in the MBA programs whatever uh you you expect certain things happening and so inventure capital in general I've seen numbers like 2015 2016 vintage you know we're talking like barely making 1X so you're you just return your money maybe even even less at a time where public markets went up you know two three bold you know

300% um so yeah I think we we could talk about stories and particular examples and people picking winners and Teslas and airbnbs but I'm talking about General story uh and last 10 15 years have not been great for venture capital and digital Health in particular in my opinion all right thank you Matthew what's your take so I think you've got to think about the underlying issue that's going on in the healthc care system so you know when I was a young boy my uh my my good Mentor I Morrison who died sadly this

week uh you know and I talked about this and we were thinking about you could get to a point where you would have a um what was then called managed care system in which uh and you know to some extent you seen some of this in Medical Advantage and some of this in the commercial sector but the goal was to have something like a bunch of competing kais of Perman entities and the goal would be they would then allocate a certain amount of money from the inp payers by the employers the government consumers whatever um and then these

atrisk medical groups essentially would control that money and will figure out what is the best way to spend money on the population that they're managing and that would Inspire them to do all kinds of good things which would you know you talk about remote patient monitoring and you know chronic Care Management all the thebuzz words we've heard about to do that at scale and to reduce costs by basically make keeping people healthier and making them better and a significant amount of the dollars going into digital

Health even going back into the 90s but certainly going into sort of the late 2000s when there was it was just starting to pick up um and certainly the teens and in the last few years have been gone companies who are trying to do something in that era in that uh Arena of making people healthier better managing the progress of patients outside the hospital managing the pro process of patients you know keeping them well chronic Care Management all of that stuff you know if you look at all the people who are getting money a

significant number of them are doing that um I would say that the underlying problem has been that the Health Care system has never gone to that kind of a payment system well I mean we have Medicare Advantage we have some commercial plans who are doing some value based care but in general we stayed the same old fever service system we always have been and if you actually look at how um and I've written on this quite extensively how uh big Medicare bage organizations pay their medical groups um human publishes on this every

few few years they actually basically pay them fee with service there's a small number of them for whom they give them the capit risk so you're not putting and maybe the health plans have got systems in place to try to manage care and obviously there's a lot of controversy about United and their use of AI to do that right now and are they going to be sued and you know are they going to be prosecut but but if you get down to it you're not really saying you're not really getting to the market

I thought we were going to get to 30 years ago which is be a bunch of capitated medical groups that kind of look like law firms across the country who use all this technology um or you know our technology companies themselves to manage care of patients people keep on trying to do this right you're seeing every every day someone will get funded with a new online care uh system which is trying to manage migraine or trying to manage uh women with men women at the age of menopause or whatever but it's not you know most people now still get

their care from either undifferentiated you know private doctors out there or big Health Systems and the big Health Systems don't give a rat's ass about saving money or Care Management they make all their money always have done by you know doing a lot of procedures in the big surgery Suites in cardiology and neurology neurosurgery and uh and Orthopedics and general surgery right so you don't have a system that's set up for these companies to succeed so I think that's the the underlying problem

then you have to look at what happened you had a lot of uh money in that sort of the period really what you it was 2021 was a height but it was really sort of you know when when we started flooding The Zone with cash in mid 2020 right after the pandemic through to about 2022 but if you looked at the numbers as soon as you got to the end of 2021 the public company started collapsing in value and it took up the private Market about nine months to a year to figure out hang on the thing that I'm investing my hundreds of

millions from SoftBank or from couille or from uh you know tiger the thing I'm investing my hundreds of millions into that I just valued at three billion has a public market equivalent that was now spaed out and is only worth you know at that point 1.5 billion now worth you know 500 300 200 million or nothing you know um and it took the private Market we seem while to figure out that especially the the sort of tourists with the later stage funds took them a while to figure out that this was a you know that they were investing in stuff that

wasn't going to be worth what they thought it was going to be worth when T do was at 300 bucks a share and worth 40 billion and bought the vongo for 19 billion it didn't look like an idiotic deal so if you rip all of that stuff out um there are some winners but they're not winners in general and I'll say the one exception the second in a second there are some winners but they're not in general helping move the market towards sort of population Health Management and consumer health their you

know managing their own healthc care and chronic illness and all the stuff that cost money they're winners in small areas like there's a bunch in revenue cycle management which is just you know can we keep more money for one player and take it from the other um increasing now in selling consumers stuff that Health Plans won't pay for to rich people particularly gp1s which is why the him stop price seems to be you know 45 42 or 45 or whatever rather than the sort of probably you know 8 to 10 it probably should be at even though it is

apparently unprofitable now um and then the old standby of we can Market to doctor we can Market drugs to doctors and doximity which is the stand out which has done a fantastic job put to get the community of doctors giving them a bunch of services and monetizing that by by selling you know Drug Company marketing which is just taking some of the drug company marketing budget which has always been huge or always double what the R&D budget was and tilting a little bit towards them the same way that Google took a bit of the newspaper advertising

budget and tilted all towards them so my my sense is that overall you know you could you can blame the sort of tourists for not really figuring out how they were investing but they were always investing into a market which didn't really want them and that brief moment in time when we thought things were going to change during the pandemic they never changed and the real reason I'll shut up after this the real well I'll show off this with my one Coda the real reason uh that that it uh that it didn't

change um is just to look at you know how the big healthare systems who run this Healthcare in this country the big nonprofit systems and you know HC and Kaiser and others um reacted when the pandemic happened right they lost all their elected care all those neurosurgery Suites and Orthopedic Su had to stop and they started bleeding money um and they had you know they had a ton of money in their reserves did they touch that no they went to the government put their hand out and got money from the government the cares Act

Right gave ton of ton of money to to those big systems and you would have thought at that point they would have gone hang on it's not very rational for us to be involved in a system where we're getting paid fee for transaction why don't we go to the government and try to switch the system and get paid some kind of Global budget to manage all the stuff we have to do because now we're doing you know Co and now we're doing we're doing uh General Care Management we're not doing we're not

doing so much of that intensive surgery and the UN didn't do that as soon as they could they got the care with people out of the hospital and they got started filling up the emergency rooms and started filling up those operating rooms and went back to the way they did it and by the way when change the change Healthcare ha happened you know and a bunch of people started going to business again because they couldn't build F service so my sense is there's very little interest in changing the system the one coder I would have is

that there's one you know if you look at consumer health where we have you know the iPhone and zoom and go we all this different sorry consumer non-health consumer technology where we have all these different uh players you know who came out of nowhere Amazon and apple and whatever you know doing totally different things than um was done before they were doing different things that was done before they weren't really replacing much you can argue that you know advertising replace newspapers you can argue that Netflix and Apple movies

are replaced you know TV but it's it's generally new stuff and there wasn't much to replace in mental health because we did a very shitty job of it and we had a massive increase in demand coming into you know a a basically since they mentioned the iPhone but exacerbated by the pandemic and you have seen some real establishment of some real mental health independent Technology based medical groups and they seem to be doing you know okay although the ones that are public like talk space and uh better help part of T do are not

probably doing as well as some of the private ones it be interesting to see what happens when the lers and the and the heads spaces of the world have to have to actually show their numbers to the world i' be interested to see how they're doing but my impression is they're doing better because there's pretty solid demand for that um so I'll shut up because I said a lot there but my sense is that it's a very complex picture um and you can blame the uh the VC Bros to some extent but I don't think

that that they've been investing them Market that wants their investees that much thank you uh James I really would love to hear your thoughts and especially I lot this Matthew's thesis um that the health system isn't really built for JAL H startups to succeed uh from VC perspective what what do you what do you think about it yeah I mean I completely agree with Matthew's point and I'll just underline it right it's it's a cost what you're trying to to sell hospitals is we want

you to do this thing in terms of digital health and similar sort of things usually not make any more money I mean the argument for the startup is always it manages it better it's better operationally or whatever but you pay this out of pocket on off of your balance sheet you don't get necessarily any more reimbursements from it or at least I can't guarantee it for a lot of these different digital Health startups and therefore what it's like it's a far easier cell unfortunately like I I I

think it's a tragedy of the healthcare system as we have it set up especially within the us but a lot of parts of the world where essentially the best sell is that you get more money with our thing because it helps you do more procedures and get paid more uh the real like startups that get a lot of funding or whatever Therapeutics because it's a pill you like you know prescribe it whatever we don't do Therapeutics but we see it uh or the alternative is you make the argument to the hospital every time

a patient walks through the door it's like the cash register like ringing like if I can make an argument to you that I can build help you build more procedures with this thing it's a new procedure or it's a thing where it's like we can justify doing more of these procedures or Diagnostics or what what have you that's an easy cell it's an extraordinarily hard cell and I've seen it like in terms of Hospital Systems where it's just a lot of hospitals will pilot things uh you have sort of your

normal names on every single startup deck where it's like we're being piloted at Kaiser at this it's like it's always the same names and it always like it very rarely turns into anything real within the broader system itself and the reason is because again your cell is essentially within a system that pays you per procedure per thing in terms of it this is just a cost I'm doing just fine in terms of where things are and you can't guarantee me that you're actually going to raise my uh my ability

to make money in terms of this so the reality is It's just tough in terms of that and you know the thing is I agree with Sergey in terms of just a lot of the different VCS don't really have great subject matter expertise uh a lot of them came in sort of chasing these returns uh especially as you saw like you know the pandemic stuff and like it got hyped and everything but at the same time the failure mode wasn't because they put the money in the failure mode was because the system just ended up not

really adopting these things as much or when you give it away the system might try it but then by the time you actually turn it try to turn it on in terms of payments uh in terms of having them at having the hospital systems actually pay that's where it failed so I mean I'd say that just in terms of nuance I really do agree with Matthew in terms of his uh synthesis of how that works in the system you know Venture Capal is there is the whole distribution right I mostly talking about people with concentration

of money right so we're talking you know pick your name you know tiger you know General Catalyst um um and horowits so I mean those are the guys with the money uh they have not delivered for sure there are a lot of smaller VCS who are doing their due diligence who are doing their job who are investing pretty well so I shouldn't be generalizing so I just want to make that distinction can can we can we dive into that a bit because um you know there are uh a couple of them so all the ones you mentioned right have made a ton of money

outside of healthcare so uh now on obviously in if you and if you add in general Catalyst which had the you know I know some of the investors in leonga who turned you know turned turned 2 into 50 or you know or three into or 30 into 500 you know uh before the stock run up right this is just uh the IPO so there was a lot of success from that we don't know we know General Catalyst owned a big chunk of L we don't know at what point they sold but clearly it was a very good thing for them they're sitting on a massive investment in

stripe um which I don't know how much of that they liquidated but you know obviously they have a lot of Firepower right and they are now doing all kinds of other things they just announced they're raising a that they're doing uh a fund with Eli ly for biologics and they just Pharm farmer stuff they've just announced they're doing private Equity management for the I don't know who for but you know I don't think I'm rich enough or maybe you guys are qualified you know to get their wealth

management but they're clearly heading down different a different path right than a traditional VC but most importantly right they put together the group that heymont calls Health Assurance they've got a whole bunch of EX senior Healthcare System people um in that you know experienced people who understand the health system well they've bought a freaking Health System you know in in Ohio assumer you know they're going down the path and they're going to start using the different ve Vehicles they've got who include

transcar on the consumer side clearly and clearly uh C which is now kind of a holding company for a whole bunch of different hospital sort of operating system stuff that they've got so they they're going down that that path in a big way I I don't know if it's early enough to call it a failure because eventually you know we're going to have a technology clash in the hospital space which is basically epic versus alternatives to Epic and epic's a very strange Beast right the core EMR with a bunch of now

stuff floating around it working in virtually every major hospital system in America um I don't think you you know you're not going to remove it there was an attempt by Jonathan Bush and theena health about 10 years ago to build a a an alternative to it he was going to do an impatient cloud-based DMR you know and and then that got killed when the the Elliot Capital Management folks came and forced him out and they just turned it back to the revenue cycle player it was and made a lot of money themselves but um you know you've got

epic expanding and if you read brenon Kea stuff you know they're now expanding all these different areas and trying to sort of do more and more with AI and the question is are there a group of companies you know for General C on the sort of hospital and Hospital SLP side who can build up enough technologies that are required by the current providers that you know that epic won't kill it all and that's a very open question that's clearly the bet that they're making on that side um I would

agree with second that if you were have sort of take out leango and take Andre I mean forget and coui and soft bank and the tourists but take the serious people who've been doing VC and health tech for a long time you know I was andreon uh General Catalyst um uh uh B coacher and U Brian Robertson venrock you know bunch of others as well if you added it all up at the moment it's not positive right they still they're still down the question is you know five 10 years down the road the those sort of Investments trying to

build a series of technology companies or a technology kuetu that can go up against epic you know is it is it going to be successful that's the the question that's the question you've got to ask about the future of venture capital and then around and outside the world there's a bunch of little things right so you know you can have a successful company like a HS or a row or whatever which is doing something that hasn't got do with the mainstream Healthcare System you know yeah I buy my GOP ones or I buy

my boldness I don't buy my boldness pills from them as you can tell but I should have bought my boldness pills from them right and and that's just a a different consumer good you got the doximity doing marketing you know look around there's a ton of people doing different stuff but in terms of core assets that manage how most people buy their healthare I think the jury is out even though the jury is probably leaning towards you know not going to make it hey methew do you consider the longo a successful invest

look but by the way we should talk about the uh we should talk about the defined Ventures piece that just came out because I I'm in the middle of writing about it and haven't finished it yet but they basically say yes this is a super successful investment look it's it's anue you you want to take a guess what's the laong asset value right now well I mean the whole thing is what under two billion so their part might be if you C break it out I know exactly 900 million or something but that's not the

point the point is where do you you know if this is stock trading if you bought at two and sold at 300 it was very successful if you bought at 300 and wrote it down to two that's exactly my point you know that's point we can argue about a bunch of stuff that went spiked out and never you know your friends are your your favorite battle and others right who who sped out got on the public market people bought it and it went bre down and it never had a had a rally but the people who bought in early in venture capital and sold out

either at the IPOs or later for them it's a good return you know if they got it right like I said I I talked to a guy at JP Morgan who uh who you know made 20x on his lebongo investment you know it's a good investment for him his F that's exactly right that that was my point that you know a lot of this um you know financing what VCS are doing unfortunately it's a you know bump and dump game so it's not that the investment was a good investment it's when do you get out so if the question

is when is the exit and how do I get out on top to me that's not a healthy environment for healthcare right now well no I I would agree so it's you know that's not look the best Venture Capital Investments are the ones where the VC can take out their money leave a bid in and the company steadily grows on forever right and and that if you go back historically I'm talking like last century VCS would wait till the company had like two or three or four or five quarters of good earnings then they

would IPO it and they would stay in for a while and the company would steadily grow up and up and eventually become you know apple or Cisco or whatever right and and the people who stayed in from the very start did very well and in the late 90s and then again in you know the late teens and certainly early early 20 s of of this Century uh it became can we put a company that is losing a ton of money out on the market and hope that it will rescue itself and by the way sell it for you know 10 get get 10 well initially it was five now

it's 10 SL 20 times revenues so I mean I love to hear you from you guys especially from James about this but but it seems to me that the that's okay with v Capital now and that's more or less okay with a lot of public market investors were much more gamblers than they were seems to me when I was a kid well that's a really important question actually and James I'll give you where in a sec but I think my question is do you feel like right now there is not enough patients on the VC side because they're all thinking not

about patience not about care but thinking mostly about rois and they are pushing startups to go either public or or merge with someone or being acquired just to get their money back and in many cases that is the reason why those companies afterwards they fail because they were pushed and moved to scale so fast so do you think that is an important case here or or not really James I mean let's make a distinction between two of those points right because there's the exit side of it that we're talking about and pushing to exit

and the scale scale as always right like the entire reason why someone would take these and I'd say for entrepreneurs and whatnot thinking about this and looking at it you need to be able to take that money and immediately translate it into massive growth that is always like the VC bet deal treadmill what have you and if you can't do that you shouldn't take VC money just Frankly Speaking because you're going to get all sorts of things messed up it's going to be very expensive money as far as it goes

especially if you aren't growing fast it's cheap if you grow fast it's very very expensive to ruinous if you can't grow fast that's one side of it so I do agree in terms of scale effects and companies probably growing too fast that's a problem but that's also a problem in terms ecosystem right like some of these Founders shouldn't be taking VC money at the stages that they do but it becomes a hot thing and you get a lot of money and things like that and so I understand but it's also

potentially delarius to the overall Enterprise Value or the founder value or everything else over time the exit sign's a little more complicated right right uh cuz I I think like Matthew was talking about leango and G Catalyst and stuff maybe some people did well in terms of some of these different companies but the problem with the specs is actually most VCS did not do well why because you have lockups so if you just literally go from hey I looked up a press release and had a can guess like what their price per share was or

whatever what their value was at the beginning and then I see what their IPO is you can basically go oh yeah they did well except they have 180 day plus lockups usually uh and in certain cases of the specs even longer where the specs went up and then they came down in a huge way and by the time you actually see the lock up ends it's like it's at sort of the the bottom in terms of it so they also didn't do particularly well for those Investments especially not for VC so you kind of have to make those

distinctions and ultimately for VC as well if you think about incentives the entire power law thing does apply right like if your thing there is that this is a really great company I'm going to make my entire fund off of this you don't want it to go public or exit or whatever early before you actually get it out because this is your one shot to basically make your fund back and make it look good and that typically is for most VC funds the case it's like one or two which means if you screw up your one

or two shot uh your fund is toast so I I would say in terms of like the exit side the incentives aren't Al line just to like push the companies out or whatnot unless the company's just not doing well in which case it's like okay well you should sell or do something or whatever to at least get a little bit of money back but those also aren't going to be Blockbuster IPOs or spcs or whatever either those are probably going to be Aqua hires or similar kinds of things so I I just put that Nuance in there in

terms of the two sides of it no I believe more creative ways of you know exiting even for Venture capitalists um but yeah I that's that's a good point and a second point is um spec operators actually did great so you know you know trath who's now off you know criticizing the government seems to done okay out of the clob and Virgin Galactic and a few yeah they got like a couple of billion in a a couple I'm not sure the people who bought those companies when back out did particularly well especially the poor people who

thought that Clover was going to be a mean stock like gain stop and bought it at you 25 whatever is never got back that was Wild Wild West it's unbelievable I mean but it is true yeah IE I would I mean I would say you know that that that if if you you can argue back and forth but I mean there is I was I was actually really interested in this the F Vance report to see that there is somebody's created an index of loss making SAS companies who are public and I didn't realize there was such a thing but they basically said compared

to that the digital Health guys aren't doing that badly which I thought was well that's like okay but these are companies who you know 20 30 years ago had never gone public um you know and and I guess that that the the question is there are a lot of people in in you know talk about James saying people are taking VC money there are people who take too much VC money right that's clear clearly been the case and I've actually talked to some of my friends who run companies saying what you know I think you should have taken the next 50

million I think you should have try to grow slower and they come up and say you know there's a combination combination of reasons why they do it one of them is everyone else is doing it and if they don't do it it looks like they they're doing something wrong so you end up with like six or seven companies all taking 200 million bucks who do nurse staffing because in 2022 and 20 21 and 22 nurses couldn't get staff and that was a very profitable business and you know that most of them are going to die um or are

already dying um but but you it there is a sort of lower level thing of smaller VCS and it doesn't matter if you ear recent or general catales these returns don't matter to you but a small bu is going into companies that you know can get sold for decent amounts of money because they're solving a particular problem and you are seeing you know a little bit of that right where there are some decent returns to companies who raised you know 8 10 12 20 million but didn't go and raise 80 150 200 you know

400 a billion or whatever so there is there is some of that and there are always sort of Niche pickups within um the world of of m&a the other thing though is of course you're seeing a lot of MMA which is forced by its investors because there are two or three companies being slammed together that have all raised too much money and the investors going okay we have to cram them together you know General Catalyst and Cur is clearly a big one of those going on right now but I mean there are many others you I think

you talked about Trill Sergey which allegedly was a fire billion dollar deal but really actually was like given away free with with with with because they couldn't figure out how to make the the underlying business work um there's a lot of that you know so and a lot of those are because the underlying business didn't fit into the health system the way they thought it was going to well the health system didn't change fast enough so that you needed whatever it was that you know true pill was doing

maybe actually pulling one of those pieces out Matthew you were talking about some of these companies doing well with just you know 581 million in terms of investment uh one of the potential bad incentives that has actually going gone into the system and going towards seres piece is how big some of these VC firms have gotten because if you're talking about that and a 10x return say right and 10x is pretty good right uh I'm oversimplifying the math massively but just say yeah I put 8 million into this a 10xt or whatever got me 80

million a lot of money unless you're a multi-billion dollar Fund in which case it's nothing right so it's like I'd much rather you have 2x or 3x my 200 million uh rather than you doing whatever it is with my 8 million or something like that so there there's a little bit of incentive there to try to push more money into some of these companies especially with some of this so I'd say there's some bad incentive there potentially and you can argue like that distorting the ecosystem I I'd agree my impression is that you

know earlier in the Zer era we got way too much money going to venture capital as a whole and there are some weird distortions I don't understand the tax reasons but there's some reasons why University endowments which have been growing massively want to put more money there but it seems to me we're getting a bit of a retrenchment of that and eventually that'll wash out and it's been much harder for for some funds at least to replenish them but but we are seeing Healthcare you know just in the

last in recent weeks we've seen some recent weeks and months some of these 100 million plus Dollar Deals well they're coming back that were every day between sort of mid 21 and and and early 23 but now you know kind of went away completely some of them started to come back which implies those later investors either you know the money's bu hold in their pocket when they could stick it in the bank at 5% or whatever um or they really believe that the IPO window is coming back and they we're going to see

some of these companies get out and I think the most interesting thing in that perspective is to see what happens I mean we had you know if you squint hard waar which is a revenue cycle management company and Tempest which is some kind of weird AI uh you know Diagnostics genox company I don't quite understand what they do but but uh you know they got out and they seem to be doing fine right on the on the market they've got they've gone up since their IPO is not down but the sort of core quote unquote

digital Health companies that you've got lined up particularly Amada particularly you know hinge I suspect you've got you know others like Maven and presumably uh you know kyal and others in that lineup who know who knows who else is going to be in that lineup um you know we're going to have to see what what a their numbers look like when their s1s get published and B when they do get out you know what happens because some of those companies by the way have been sitting you know Amada was founded in 2010 it's

not like you know a quick pump and D for them it's been 15 years as a private company um I heard that included Health was now you know thinking about going public in 22 actually you know hasn't gone public is apparently profitable now would love to see the numbers there and see if you can see establish some some companies and also the other thing just to to finish this point is some more of those public companies that are that are dead but kind of dead men walking but have valued at 200 300 400 million you

know the lower end of the of Sergey list 123 they've got to go away you know and some of them are right transcar B Accolade rolled up that up 600 million or something when it was trading at about a value of market cap of 300 but it had been trading in a billion you know not very manyy months earlier so maybe it was a good deal buy them some market share you know maybe maybe you see more and more of those rollups including the public companies which will give some space for new valuations for the hinges and the Modas to go

public it's going to be really interesting seeing that uh just to add color on two of those points uh the endowments and pensions thing I can actually speak on because I've worked with a lot of them in terms of Bridgewater days and whatnot and also on the VC side the reason why was because interest rates were so low if you're trying to pay pensioners and you promis them a certain percentage just because interest rates are zero doesn't mean that the pensioners will go oh I understand you're not paying me

anymore right so you need to go further out on the risk curve to go get returns which is why VC became so popular be and PE and these other things that are higher risk interest rates haven't come down back to zero which means you're not going to see that same kind of surge anymore on the other side VC funds have actually gotten longer and longer in the tooth like technically those fund structures are supposed to be 10 plus 1 plus one there's two uh like oneyear like you know extension periods in

reality if you actually talk to investors in VC they kind of joke about it it's like it's 10 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 plus 1 it's like the true the true length of most VC phones is actually now like 15 16 plus years and you can see various reports on this from um Carta svb some of these other folks um and the thing is it's like it's hard to pump and dump because the issue is it's like the time frames are so long in terms I you were talking about leango these others like how long they've actually sat there

and these are just again just two nuances in terms of just looking at the ecosystem within VC and what's evolved over time right I agree with that and and and that's why I don't expect me many IPOs this year or next year to be completely honest with you I mean we talk about M and and hit and I guess that's because they they announced by the way it's been like eight months and you know nothing's happening uh but like outside of that I I don't expect many uh for that same reason is that you know um

I think VC are finding more creative waves ways to um to become rich they they don't have to go uh public to be completely honest with you so do you think do you think hypocritic is not going to go public anytime soon not anytime soon so I mean yeah that's that's that that company is by the way quote unquote officially you know only uh only 14 months old you know do do you know what their to your previous point they raised two rounds of investment the past four months I believe I mean but I'm saying that that

well and there's a weird thing going on so just and I'd love all of your comments on this one right so there's two things going on at once right one is there is has been a kind of a rejigging and we've talked about k a couple of time talk about Kum but hypocritic is there also another General Catalyst company a bunch of others cuen raised a bunch of money um uh uh innovas others you know who are kind of inside the hospital operations plays to go up against essentially to go up against epic you know and there's a bunch of

companies and you go on the HS floor and you wander around hyms yeah you see the big epics and you know cner is still plugging well Oracle now plugging away and metatech are all plugging away but you see a bunch of other companies on that FL most of them are doing weird stuff in the back office of hospitals that you've never heard of right but are really big players you know and and and and my sense is there's a bunch of people coming for them like the people do document management that's and other

revenue cycle management stuff that there's a bunch of people coming for them operating rooms scheduling and all that stuff right so I think a lot of guys are going for you know coming after that segment and which is where those big big grounds are coming so that you know so to me that's like that's that's one big chunk of of of the activity um the other thing is that there's AI woow woo in general obviously ambient AI in in healthcare is the big area in healthcare ambient AI with uh you know

Nuance by Microsoft but also a bridge nabla ambient Ambience ambient and a bunch of others right Suki a bunch of other others who are Venture back to or or or or others and that is growing super fast that part of the market seems to be a very you a product that really helps the doct to this flow and you know it's not that expensive for the for the savings they're getting get it yet it probably fits in James's you we going to save you money and help you build faster because you can see more patience um

equation um and then this is all against the background and then when you say so I think only one or two of them are going to get out where the stock market is insanely high right based mostly on the valuation of seven particular companies one of which is the COO which is running around trying to destroy the American government in the world at the moment as we speak you know so but it's all based on AI and as we said we mentioned you mentioned at the start of this Alex deep seek right you know people are still trying to figure out

does that mean that well this AI spending is CRA is crazy bad crazy good no one quite understands what it means but if you look at the sort of overall stock market if you can't get out now with the amount of fervor and the height the stock market you know what's going to happen in two years if we have a bare Market if AI goes away I mean then they're never going to get out so my sense is that yes I know things were crazy in 2020 and 2021 but they're crazy now again for different reasons just we have this

problem with digital Health the failure digital Health whereas all the other companies that went public in that time many of them have done pretty well if you look at the general stas companies and the air companies you know and there are areas I know biotch James is an area which hasn't done it so well but to to me I think you you've got to argue that yeah there's a lot of money that's been sitting there patiently for a long time now yeah soge you can say people make money other ways they make money on 2%

there are secondary sales there are you know companies that seem to be never going to go public I mean why is Strike not gone public when it's worth what 100 billion and you know it's been around for a long time those guys have figured out they don't need to go public even though they investors money in there but in general eventually the investors need to get their money out and the only way you get out get it out is an m&a deal or or uh in general is a big m&a deal private comes in and buys it or you go public so

we're not seeing enough for those you guys understand better than I do how uh how the the strip Brothers managed to be the richest guys in Ireland or in Europe without having going public but yeah they said explicitly when I go on IPO so um I don't remember why but but they may have a ton of venture capital in there and at some point those guys as James point out need their returns cuz they're limited have to pay their pensioners you know the have to S their pension I wish someone would give me a

pension should have work for the government well i' have been getting one of those letters by now HP hypocritic is actually a good example I think of why venture capital is not going IPO and let's be honest those companies that run by Venture Capital there's some Founders or opinion is basically so minute is is not even funny um so right now with the latest valuation uh do you know what the multiple is on hypocritic Revenue it's it's exactly 200 right now have you have you seen any company you know over over

100 I mean uh they they they slap valuations like like they basically wake up and say you know what how we how are we going to value and it's because again and you know James know knows that stuff you have a you have a basically a group of VCS you know sitting at a table you know drinking beer it's it's very different going to public markets and basically being exposed to million votes out there and they know that's not the valuation they know it's not 1.

6 billion I mean it's it's never going to be um but in you know in in private markets they can do you know whatever the hell they want and so that there's a little bit of of that going on so why would they go to to public markets if they're sitting right there and waiting for some you know schmuck to come in and and oh you know we're gonna we're going to unload you know a few shares here and there so yeah it's I understand secondaries are completely liquid but you know you just waiting and then you

know seeing what happens because they know for sure Public Market is gonna destroy them that's kindon of I'd love to James talk about about this because uh you know they have to get out at some point right um yes you can you can make up you can make up a valuation do you like also you know what's the valuation of the money you put in versus the next round of money coming in and what the what's the that's exactly right preference rate and you have a three times liquidation preference all that

kind of good stuff right so it depends who you are as to what the valuation is um I remember Jeff tagney from uh do Sim came on health once he said at one point the board had to appoint a special committee to identify what the interest of the board was because there were so many people in ocres who had money in at so many different levels so different preference shes they couldn't figure out who was trying to get out who was going to get out at what price and you know it was confusing but James I'd love

to hear more about what you know what you think about this kind of exit yeah I mean this stuff is it's it's tough right because there there is a Nuance between different companies I mean I'd say that the thing in for private companies that are almost semi-public are mostly ones within the mcconomy so like say xai SpaceX etc those trade almost like public stocks just within private markets and stuff but most other stuff you still need to get out somehow and you need to get out through IPO and the issue that I hear

plenty of complaints uh the VC's want the companies to IPO the only problem is they look at it and yes they'll get destroyed in the public markets for multiple reasons in terms of it and it's not it's just not going to be able to happen now just to be fair to like 200x or 300X or 500x Revenue I mean you take a pre-revenue say medical device or Therapeutics company and then you try to Value it I mean any value that you put on it that's greater than zero is an infinite like is is an infinite like uh like you know

price to revenue like ratio right so it's I mean it depends like if they really think that it's going to grow that kind of like raid or whatever but you can do the calculations on it you can like definitely cast out on if they're ever going a grow into their valuation uh but there is a reason for a like really really really high like you know price to revenue ratio value to revenue ratios if you think the thing is going to grow a ton but yeah I mean it's tough in this environment I just say that as far as it goes the VCS aren't

doing particularly well especially within this particular area it's at the end of the day it's like they still need to get out there still aren't that many Alternatives secondaries are arguable at this point but usually it's just the hype companies that are able to make U like utilize those and someone like Hippocratic or whatever it's like I doubt it uh unless the VC is trying to cash out at like a 80% discount to the last round or something like that in which case that they probably wiped out

most of their return and it no longer looks like VC returns anymore um it's just a tough market for a lot of these private companies and a lot of them are staying private just because yeah you're right they will get destroyed in public markets but it's not because they don't want to do it it's because they can't get out so there's a distinction between I'm trying to hide it from the market and I'm trapped here and I'd say that most folks are trapped here more than anything else I think it's there's a

little bit of like Newman Marcus sale going on in in the mall right so you go to Newman Marcus and you see like whatever an evening gown rate and they're saying 80% off well I mean it was 10 ,000 now is 2,000 I mean it's still crazy right so I think there's a little bit of that going on as well we we're gonna jack up the valuation as much as possible and then even if it's 80% discount we're still gonna get out on top so I think there's a little bit of of that going on and but usually they

don't though that's that's the issue it's just like usually General Catalyst um I don't know to me from what you know what I'm hearing and they can often push their their shares to you know to the next guy um to me it's a little weird because there's I always thought a reputation is should be important but doesn't seem to be in some of this areas but you know I mean it's part of the nature of getting big I mean the criticism that I think is right is they become huge so

they're incentive structures everything has changed quite a bit I think you wrote about this and it's a common saying two is greater than 20 as long as your AUM is high enough and you can make money in other ways for it yeah ultimately in the longer term they still need to return money to LPS uh limited partners like the investors and the funds they still need to get the stuff out and the problem with the secondaries again is like and I'll just say this just from seeing the market uh there's a

lot of talk about secondaries It generally doesn't happen like usually the secondaries firms will approach VCS and basically say I will buy your best company out of your portfolio at you know 80% 90% discount and I will not take your other companies or I'll only take them for like next to free like that that doesn't tend to look like a great like deal in terms of which is why a lot of these things just don't happen no matter what you know like secondaries firms say like oh a bunch of great deals

are happening well obviously they that's their incentive right to talk about it that way but it it's just usually quite an unattractive which is why a lot of these transactions also aren't happening so that's also why VCS haven't been returning money to their LPS uh which is a complaint from all the LPS it's not that they're able to exit and then Something's Happened uh if that actually happened the VC mark would actually unfreeze some because then LPS would get their money back and then they'd be able

to put more money into VC the problem is that cycle has been frozen they committed a bunch a lot of the capital isn't actually getting deployed but also no capital is coming back from the funds so there's no cycle and the entire thing is just a frozen tundra in terms of a lot of the different private markets and VC right now they continue investing you know I'll I'll continue pouring money and that's to me is a is is a big mystery you know but lots of mysteries here but uh we talked about lots of important things

but I'm trying to position myself as a an actually am a star founder as well and there a star Founders that are going to listen to this episode what kind of lesson should they learn from everything we discussed uh in their SP Journey well I mean I I have some general advice I think it's look it's super hard I do a lot of work um harassing you know VCS on behalf of early stage Founders and it's a brutal thing I did a survey of early stage Health tech companies in the height of the craziness I mean 202 2 um

on behalf of a Professional Services Company when I was still running the remnants at Health 2.0 Catalyst at Health 2.0 and uh you can see the survey and even at that point right where you heard1 million rounds coming you know coming down from falling off trees all the time 50% of startup Founders said it was really really hard for them to raise money and it just is by definition you know more people are calling the VCS and they on so the the number one piece of advice is really to think about do you want to

spend two years of your life trying to or maybe more trying to raise enough money to get this business going that's number one number two is can you do it another way is there a way that you can make it on Revenue don't forget the most successful company in the history of America well one of them Microsoft done all on Revenue right didn't didn't have any VC back back backed and you know there's there's plenty of examples of companies that that did it that way um you know did it without or raising a

dribble right um can you know my my advice is can you see the thing really taken off I mean you know if you're beating your head against the wall for months years you know months a year several years you've got a thing and nobody cares that's the market telling you something you know so I always like to say is the thing taking off dramatically so you you know then that's a great that's a great thing you can then take to invest and then you can be choosing the investor rather than you know begging for the investor um

the third thing which I think is what James's point you know was is that you should be very judicious in once you're in that position where you it's working you know you're people offering you money you're having good conversation with VCS You' be very judicious about how much you take and how much it you know how much it it's going to cost you to build out but you don't want to run out so because there could be a time it comes and you've got to be able to say well yeah things weren't going as well

as I thought we didn't get to break even as quickly as I thought or this other opportunity came up or something happened and you know want to have a bit of flexibility um and my great example here is go back to our friends at doximity who took who were profitable took $50 million in led by canvas Rebecca in there super smart investor who doesn't make many Investments but they usually very good when she does uh she put it in and they they that $50 million you look at their S1 sat on their balance sheet for the rest of the

time where they went public and it probably turned into like you know 15 two billion by the time they went public a lot of money now and I always you know wonder why did they do that why do they take money they didn't really need it and I think the answer was they wanted just to have some assurance that in case things didn't go the way they thought or whatever they weren't going to you know and they were they were running on fumes and weren as profit as they thought they were that you know they would they would

survive and they PR to pay basic buy insurance for it rather than buy money they know they're going to spend down immediately um and then has to go back and ask again so that that's my thought is that you should try to you know try to figure out if the thing you're building is really a really good business that people want as quickly as possible now by the way Koda the most fastest growing company in digital Health ever you know knew was doing that raises a ton of money and then ran into disaster I'm talking about cerebral

right here which was online prescribing them and fetamines basically but uh you know they never made you know even though they were growing like crazy and could have been a very Prof business if they before they got arrested or whatever they took in a lot of money and so they never got out of the way and end up with the CEO getting fired and suing his investors for trying to push him into it all of so you have to think carefully about it but yeah it's it's I mean I would say that there are some of these businesses that are never going to

work if they don't get the first one two five million in you're never going to figure out if it does work or not so can't avoid it I I mean I I think that's I think I completely Echo Matthew's points in terms of that the thing that is always attractive to early Founders firsttime Founders whatever is just taken as much money as possible uh at whatever points possible or whatever and in a way that you would never do if you did it on a loan right like if you thought about as a loan you would

realize like I can't make use of this money in this particular way and thus it's not a good idea I can't pay this money back or whatever it always feels easier if it's Equity because you technically don't have to pay that back but ultimately that's still costing you in terms of overall like cap table in terms of what your Equity is it also costs you down the line in terms of if there's a Down Round if there's other things down rounds are terrible uh from the perspective of with a company like

you end up having everyone crushed in the cap table and if you play around with the math you'll actually see the Down Round effects are actually much much much worse for your overall you know like ultimate as a founder or even as an early stage investor but as a Founder like what you what outcomes you get this is partially how Trill ended up with nothing right like there other reasons and other stuff but even if they got the full amount whatever it is like the Down Round would have crushed them into almost nothing just because of the

way that multiplicative effects in these things work you want to think of it almost like a loan you know that I can make use of this money in the case of doximity like insurance is fine like you know you can make use of it as insurance and you're willing to pay like the interest quote unquote that's totally fine but you need to know why you're doing this and I know it's super attractive especially as you're struggling and bootstrapping through and like eating Ramen and other stuff to try

to make the company work to just like if I get a bunch of money everything will be solved but usually the reality is it isn't like the money doesn't usually solve these problems ultimately what you need is the business to work in which case maybe you don't even need the money uh that'd be great but if you do need the money and you know exactly where you'll put it that's the right time to do it otherwise uh you shouldn't just Willy nearly walk into it because that's just uh deletar is to everyone and again

it's really easy to say this it's really easy the startup Journeys are super hard and I felt this myself through some of mine uh but you really do need to put thought into it and know exactly how you're going to get to that next Milestone where you where the money is worth it so that that's really the thing I'd say to encourage folks to really think hard about uh because it's just too easy to like take the money and whatever if you're offered yeah when you I think when when the next time James Wong calls you and

tries to get you to invest in your company you have to call the other James W and say is this a good idea I mean the reality is that I'm not sure like how much people I mean I think they should listen to this podcast for this ideas and uh um suggestions and kind of um thoughts but in in reality you know unless you're somebody like monal from hypocritic who just have all this easy money for on the sky um I think most Founders are looking for pretty much any way to find Capital like in my startup um you know we ended

up bootstrapping but honestly not by choice it just kind of happened um and so um but if if there is a choice I would say definitely a look for investors who are um similar-minded that are easy kind of to communicate with they're not going to be authoritarian if if you know if if you can kind of predict that some sometimes you cannot uh because I think the last thing you want is for you know investors taking over your business and um kind of um you know questioning your initial Mission because I think in the end of

the day there are a lot of smart investors but that's your idea as a Founder you come up with that that's your inovation so every time somebody says oh you know look at the market you have to Pivot I think you have to ask yourself like what are you doing here um and you know um Matthew gave an example of doximity I I'm looking at my spreadsheet and I'm gonna give an example of via systems so there's the company via systems publicly traded veev I have no ownership on that I'm just looking at PR who is the most

successful company in my spreadsheet that's Venture Capital backed which means it's not number one in the spreadsheet but it's exra number five because that's that's that's the highest VC backed uh so so so this is what what they've done this is basically a CRM sort of um Salesforce kind of CRM company for medical organizations and sure enough it's the former uh Salesforce executive who started the company and what they did was basically they said you know what we're just going

to focus we're just gonna focus on our costs we're just gonna make profitability as our top goal you know not some growth not some Mission just profitability so they fund an early investor emergeny Capital so it wasn't one of the big guys right so uh and you know they only got $4 million and um after that they quickly became profitable um and now there I think almost almost 40 billion doar company so out of 4 billion Venture gotal money made profit because that was their their their their focus and said thank you

very much we're gonna take it from there and so that basically and I think the this the the lesson there is that basically we sees complete trusted Founders mission and vision and they they kind of stayed away they said we're just going to invest in you we we trust you with judgment and they St they stayed the hell out of the company and the company did well so that's kind of like the that's that's by the way they the outlier on average we see that companies didn't do so well so and V is a great example right they

essentially did they were they knew their clients they had their clients lined up they basically did on Revenue they got a little bit to be honest a bit of walking around money to to make sure that they you know they were okay but you know and it was a while ago right that was like 2012 2013 when they went public in 2016 something like that 2017 you know 201 so so so to me it actually sounds a little bit like spun-off company which usually do well because they already have connections and and and corporate backing uh but you know so

I actually you know maybe I should reclassify the company in my spreadsheet so one one last quick question um and we actually did not talk about tech the whole episode but I I was kind of wanted to end with the tech you know there's this trend and lots of people saying that we're going to see soon lots of companies with one two employees with the help of Pi that might become unicorns do you think with the help of Pi star Founders is for them it's going to be much easier to bootstrap now because you literally you

don't need to raise millions of dollars because you don't need staff of 300 people I've heard this story forever right oh it's so cheap now that there's web based tools to build a thing and do this and you can do it for no money and all the time companies raise more and more money in the end especially in healthcare you have to go sell it to somebody which either requires massively expensive consumer advertising or massively long sales Cycles with you know Biff Biff the sales guy you know

who knows all the people at the hospital or the health plan or whatever it seems to me that that maybe the technology generation is cheaper certainly you know was cheaper you I was in a startup in 2000 we had a sun like array server in an office with a cooling system whatever and then by 2005 8 10 no one had that you had rack space and now everyone has AWS well they charge you a lot of money you know so you it's definitely cheaper the technology is cost and Building Technology coming down and down all all

the time and apparently now one smart guy Sergey with his you know using claw can uh program you know what would take a thousand people back in the NASA time or whatever so I think I hear that but I don't see the cost of Staffing out a full company to be not sheer but maybe I'm wrong I would agree with Matthew that um I I think AI may think may think on the margin more efficient I don't see how that's gonna necessarily change company changing which like you know solar founder and like nobody else and like

build something with all this like csor or whatever I think like longterm I I don't think it's it's a standle I think first of all it's going to help larger companies to fight efficiency I think that's that's what I'm seeing uh so like whatever 1,000 2,000 uh person companies uh maybe fighting some some some inefficiencies that's I think that's to me more realistic having said that I think a lot of this AI scribes that Matthew mentioned a lot of them basically exactly what it was they they

took a rapper around ch and here we go we have a an a scrip company so I count 126 in my sample um I don't see many innovators there so um so you know here we go so sometimes I think AI could be good but in this case I think it's kind of crowd in the market with all this AI tourists unfortunately yeah I I'll take a slightly different perspective on this and if you look at sort of a longer term span and actually going back to some of the Matthew's point in terms of back in the VC is used to fund ideas more but

also the valuations were much lower at least relatively speaking inflation whatever what have you back in the day why because to start a company say Nvidia in terms of starting out you needed a bunch of people you needed a bunch of Hardware you needed a bunch of different things and even for a web startup or whatever you needed your own servers you need someone to manage them you need a bunch of different people to do all this and then over time you got AWS and things you got cloud-based stuff it became easier to program because you

weren't doing it in Cobalt and whatever you know just just I'm sort of making it exaggerating but just over time developer productivity tools a lot of these other things for these software startups became easier this is also another step in that direction just like you had a bunch of Frameworks and stuff and like package managers and other stuff that make just building the code easier this will probably make building the code easier and maybe you can actually get further before you need to raise any funding and

hire more people so two people in a garage can do even more now than before in which case I like to talk about Market inefficiencies but at least this part of the Market's somewhat efficient where yeah probably entry valuations will get higher uh for VC and that's a good thing because the companies are further along there's more progress there's more other things but that's I think how the adjustment will work uh it's not a c change suddenly where it's just like okay now like two people are you know

running doximity or whatever and it's just like all done in terms of that it's just more likely it's like okay entry valuation some of these other things will be higher because it's it'll be easier for you to go for longer and do stuff with fewer people which is great um but that's the same as package managers and everything else uh it's an incremental step in that direction maybe it's a big incremental step but it's not a fundamental change in how the market has been evolving

anyway My Hope for that it could and I think it's already doing that could generate you know much better ideas much better Innovation and eventual value add uh to to our industry all right I think we had another amazing episode lots of great insights uh thank you so much gentlemen and yeah looking forward to to hear some feedback about our thoughts this is great awesome thanks everyone
