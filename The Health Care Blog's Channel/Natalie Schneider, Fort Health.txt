Hi Matthew h another thcb Spotlight here and I'm uh visiting with Natalie Schneider Natalie is the CEO of for health which is uh another a company which is uh in the uh Child and Adolescent mental health field there are a number of other companies in this space um we probably run the bright line and little little ERS and be and a few of the others but but uh as anybody who has kids knows um especially if you I was actually on a that was on a school tour last night counseling mental health and teen kid and teen mental health has become a really really big deal in recent years especially since the pandemic um so why don't we start off now tell me a little bit you've been uh doing this you've been elsewhere in the world of Health Tech and uh and health insurance previously but um you've been doing this company for now three years now 

I think LEF for health so tell me a bit about why you decided this was the thing to go into and what your approaches like yourself I'm I'm a parent first and also a sort of Health Advocate uh second third and fourth and uh between my partner and I we have five kids so not only have we seen sort of various aspects of Mental Health Care unfold around the dining room table we're also in a community where friends and family are telling us it's 15 weeks to get in to see a therapist or a psychiatrist even when I get in uh they're not accepting my insurance no one's coordinating with my pediatrician so it quickly became evident that this was a space that needed additional attention so that's that sort of like piqu my interest and then I started speaking to uh folks sort of in the Pediatric space and I was on a walk with uh lovely friend of 

mine who's who's a pediatrician and uh she's she's at my age so very young Matthew and just in high school yes she said she said I'm quitting and she said Natalie most of the kids that come in have a behavioral health condition and I have 15 minutes to diagnose these kids and in some cases prescribe and she said I'm just not this isn't what I trained to do I was trained as a pediatrician and as I started to look into it she was absolutely correct uh mental health is now the most common presenting condition in a pediatrician's office um back in 2019 in fact mental health disorders surpassed uh physical conditions is the most common reason kids ever impairment and yet most pediatricians didn't complete uh child or adolescent Psychiatry rotation so we we sort of putting them in in this position of being Frontline Behavioral Health Providers 

without the requisite training or support uh so that was really the birth of Fort health is we need to be in the space and what's the right way to do it uh and the headline is the right way to do it is in partnership with pediatricians okay so what is the approach that you then take so you talking about partnership with pediatricians but I mean obviously there are there are kids who come to uh mental health from a variety of places there's a lot of self-referral going on uh as you know and there are a lot of companies now um both in the sort of standard adult mental health uh virtual space but also in the Pediatric space you know who are either going for our plans or employers or somehow else trying to trying to get there so what is your strategy for attracting patients um kids and then what do you do to be in conjunction with pediatrician 

uh so if we start with the front of the funnel it's one in five kids has a behavioral health condition that needs treatment of those children that get diagnosed I live in Marine County it's about one in one in one in one go yeah it's you know consistent and persistent um issue and of the kids that are diagnosed about 75% are diagnosed by the primary care provider so this is the widest biggest front door there are other channels and about you know um 10% get treatment from a school counselor or school psychologist Etc but most kids see their pediatrician every year 93% uh most kids getting diagnosed are getting diagnosed by a pediatrician um and pediatricians are trying to keep up and play that role about 85% of psychotropics which are medications that affect our mood and our behavior and that are being prescribed by pediatricians right so 

that's that's really the state we're in and if we play to where the park will be and we sort of look at the crystal ball we already know there's an issue with supply of Pediatricians and I'm sure Matthew you read the same reports that I did that last year about 30% of uh pediatrician residency spots went unfilled so few fewer people going into it uh many more pediatricians uh retiring uh so you've got these uh very valuable pediatricians that are spending more and more and more of their time on mental health so our model is to be a wraparound for those pediatricians and deliver not only integrated care uh but also uh collaborative care which is a very different clinical model okay okay say a bit more about what that means right so now so you're getting uh referrals from P divisions fair enough how do they know about you and then what do you 

do and what do they do do they do they still do the prescribing what services do you offer just go down a bit about what is the actual experience like for a patient if they get referred by their ption to Ford Health what happens next yeah so the pediatrician will refer to us um using whatever workflow they use today so that could be an eax a call it could be using a portal whatever they do today that's the most important thing not to upset their their workflow once we uh we get that referral uh we do Outreach to to the family we get them enrolled in care that's either therapy and Psychiatry which is what most people are familiar with or it's a model called collaborative care uh which is probably one of the most well studied Mental Health you know interventions of the last decade uh over 90 randomized control trials to support it's twice as 

good as usual care for anxiety depression ADHD Etc it's one of those two and then what makes the model unique and why pediatricians really like this model is that is Clos Loop we go back to that pediatrician we say we've either got your kiddo in care or we did Outreach to the family couldn't reach them uh do you have a different contact number and we provide those treatment updates and discharge summaries and in some cases that's dropped directly onto the patient record what they're telling us is that is differentiated and that is incredibly helpful because today as you know uh if I walked into a pediatrician's office uh with one of my kids and um they diagnosed with u anxiety I'd be given a sheet of paper and as the parent I'm quarterbacking that care and I'm calling various providers to try to get that person in so we take all of that 

administrative uh lifting of both the pediatrician and the parent so now you've got the patient um and they and you referred back either way and you you've Tracked Down the family or you've done whatever you've done to get them what happens next uh what are the services you actually delivering directly to the patient so the services that are delivered is evidence-based measurement-based um therapeutic interventions so therapy and while that sounds like just a lot of words it is shocking to note that only 20% of Behavioral Health Care today is evidence-based and measurement based which means you know in layman's terms we saying objectively we don't have the data to determine when that child is ready ready to be discharged so it is evidence-based measurement based care uh we have a partnership with the child mine Institute who's a nonprofit 

in this area uh that's developed training exclusively for our providers um and we track that their child throughout their course of care uh provide the pediatrician updates and when their child is ready to be discharged you know we do that with the benefit of data so that's with therapy and Psychiatry with collaborative care that is a separate set of CPT codes um that model is very well established in the adult population it is much more novel in the child population and with collaborative care it is much higher frequency much shorter interventions so it's not sitting down for 55 minutes which you know kids are not very good at um and plus if your therapy appointment is Tuesday 300 p.m. you know what's the likelihood you're going to remember what happened last Friday and last Wednesday Etc so that's why I really love collaborative care 

because they are uh Behavioral Health interventions that happen much more frequent frequently and in that model the pediatrician stays the prescriber so we become sort of the behavioral health intell side uh the psychiatrist is on alto uh the Behavioral Health Care managers on our staff but we maintain the Integrity of that relationship between the pediatrician and the patient and the pediatrician stays the prescriber so in terms of collaborative care just to give me sense for the the patients you're treating kids you're treating how many go into which the more traditional model how many go into Pro uh collaborative care then in terms of collaborative care I mean how does that actually work so now I've gone to get my kid in front of a video call three times a week twice a week what what am I doing that what's different than the once a week or 

twice or or twice a month whatever you know talking to a or once a month often it's talking to a psychiatrist or a therapist that that currently happens or they might get a school or whatever yeah um so in terms of uh nationally what the mix is and I'm not sure because there are not very many companies doing Child and Adolescent collaborative care but for Fort Health it's probably sort of 4 fths one5 because we just launched collaborative care last year there's been really good uptake uh pediatricians are really excited about it parents are really excited about it uh and one of the nuances uh that's really important from a affordability perspective is there's one co-pay a month for collaborative care and that doesn't seem like a big deal but if you are a mom that came to us last week uh that has three kids that uh need therapy um and if each of 

those three kids is doing therapy once a week you know you're looking at 4 8 12 copay potentially month and that can really add up even though we we take insurance so collaborative care is much more affordable uh for the parent it's much more clinically effective Etc and in terms of hard works it's um right out the gate it's much more intensive treatments so much higher frequency um but still short duration and um sort of second month third month Etc it starts to sub subside it's very much driven by the child's needs as opposed to therapy today as you know uh the fact that every Thursday let's say at 3:00 I'm saying my therapist and that may not be when I most need therapy um I may not have a perfect recollection of what's happened over the past week Etc so I think especially for kids I'm really excited about the potential of this model um it's 

well researched it's it's well uh supported by the literature um and I know payers are very excited about it as well because it integrates physical health and mental health and the research mimon and and those sorts of reports suggest that you get to get a 9 to 177% uh savings on your claims cost when you start to uh make that that integration So speaking as a as a parent who went through this process with a with a different organization one of the one of the things that that I didn't enjoy much and don't think was very helpful was that the fact that there was a lot of in the early sessions of with me and the and the kid in front of the uh in front of the psychologist and uh with the therapist was there was a lot of instruction to me which I thought was kind of a waste of time I wanted to see more focus on on the kid but there are always these 

things that a parent is supposed to know about you know how to manage behavioral issues and this that and the other um and I assume that that that probably gets replicated by not so much pediatricians but therapists across the board Across America raw telling parent stuff that they could probably learn in different ways so how have you approached that that is uh I'm so glad you raised that because um number one the research in literature is so clear that if you educate the parent your clinical outcomes are so much better which makes sense because we're with our kids most of the time and uh but you white spending the first two to three sessions on something that could be self-taught is a waste of time and uh we learned this pretty quickly so we developed a parent education course it's 10 lessons and um it's based Loosely off a lot of the concepts 

uh one of our partners Dr Harold copperwoods includes in his book scaffold parenting but as soon as the fam is referred to us their course goes out to the parent and they can choose to listen to it on the way to soccer practice or or whatever it is and their companion guides and worksheets Etc so they are being very very efficient with their time with the therapist or psychologist all right that's great and do you think that I I we we've touched on this a little bit before in the interview but do you think there's a eventual companion course for for the kids as well or do you think that as you said you you're hesitant to want to do technology for the kids uh and and and whether that's a good UCB engineering dollars um although I think they're all free now aren't they with AI with deep seek but who knows but I mean do you think there's an eventual 

sort of companion course for for for kids as well and there there sort of potentially AI or other forms of technology play into that yeah that is that's something we piloting right now to figure out how do you hit the right balance we know that with apps 97% of them are discarded within within two weeks uh so that might not be the right solution but how do you reinforce that they are making progress that there's momentum and sort of reinforce those learnings I definitely think there is room for that give me a sense of where you think you you are you guys are relatively new as a business I know you raised U um raised some money a couple of years back and then had another round uh just just more recently back back into the last year um give me a sense of where you are in terms of where you are which states you're available uh where you're accessible 

um how many families have gone through the program or going through the program just give me a sense of sort of that that part and then how big organization you are um so our our first full year of operations was in 2023 and we've served about um 2500 families uh in that time and uh started with New Jersey Pennsylvania New York we've just expanded into Texas and Illinois um we are Insurance based so that is at the core of our mission is we want to expand access to Quality Care so our philosophy is we will try and get to 100% covered lives you know or as close to that as possible and that has benefits and drawbacks the benefit is it makes it very frictionless for pediatricians to refer we say we take pretty much everyone now it's right now it's only in commercial for our FIFA service business it's commercial and Medicaid for for collaborative care 

the drawback as you know is they very variable reimbursement rates from payer to payer so you know you've got some payer contracts that are going to be a little bit of a drag on your margin philosophically though we believe that that that is worth it because we're trying to make lives easier for pediatricians and families um you know right out the gate what we were trying to prove is we had a Theory and this was really informed by my time at Anthem which is now elepant that healthc care is super local it's super relationship driven um Innovation happens locally with the health systems with the provider groups Etc and the easiest way for us to get the flywheel going is deeply saturate a market uh so that's why we started with new New Jersey we now have one in three pediatricians in New Jersey have referred to us is great and we decided not to do a 

national model because of the administrative overhead and complexity of maintaining all of those legal entities cross lure etc etc etc filing taxes I mean it seems like a little thing but you compound all of that work so that bit has play has has um has paid off and that will continue to be our strategy to do a slower Market expansion but to go really really really deep in each of those markets so what does it take to staff out um any one of those so if you're relatively close to maturity in New Jersey for example um what what number of you know how big a medical group do you need there what's the composition of it what are they doing you know give me a sense about uh what what does you know what does Ford Health at scale and any one market look like uh um that's a great question and a complicated one to answer because um the case loads are so 

different between collaborative care and FIFA service collaborative care for example you know you looking at between sort of 70 to 85 patients in a case load it's a much more efficient model um with uh you know FIFA service therapy you're really looking at you know a considerably small case load especially with kids because kids are in school all day you know you can see kids from sort of 3:30 to 8:30 onwards but in terms of lure types it is um license um uh social workers lcsws uh a handful of psychologists psychiatrists psychiatric nurse practitioners that is our primary mix um we do not not staff with unlicensed therapists um just because we're relatively small and one of our sort of focuses and priorities is how do we maintain consistency right and it's probably imperfect analogy but if we want to be Starbucks that if you order a frappuccino 

it doesn't matter if it's from your local corner store here or or when in New York like it's getting made the same way our clinical pathways are the same like is a consistency in our care uh and how we do our training Etc which is much sort of easier to do with a more contained set of licens types and so I I suspect that mean you can have a relatively small number of of clinical Professionals in only one state does that sound does that sound about right I don't know how I'm trying to what I'm trying to get at is you know two things one is can you know how can you easily SC if you get separation in the market and then do this Market Market approach um or state-by-state approach can you you know is it relatively easy for you to grow the medical group that you're you're creating in each of those States because that seems to be a significant problem 

with a lot of online therapy not so online uh mental health not just in in uh in in kids but in general it's like you know you hire therapist don't stay around a long time you know there's a lot of turnover and then that ends up being problems with the quality of the care so I'm going kind trying to figure out how you'll thinking I assume that this is one of the major problems you have if you tell me this is easy and you want to tell me the other problems that's great but I suspect this is this is a big issue for you yeah um I'm glad you raised that because I think that's a common misconception um there are providers out there and they are hirable and we are um actually ahead of our hiring targets and because we have a mix of uh part-time W2 workers in1 1099 you know just about everyone has gone to the 1099 model so I think our staffing model is 

probably fairly common um that is not the primary issue I think one of the challenges is that in Tech enabled Services there are sort of always two pressure points and the one pressure point is reimbursement rates and the other one is labor costs and over the last several years as uh Mental Health Care Services have become more prevalent um demand is up that has put um extraordinary pressure on Supply so we've seen sort of wages inflate over time and they have not been commensurate with reimbursement rates so I think that that is a challenge for the whole industry and in fact if you look way back sort of reimbursement rates uh you know from 200 7 to about 2017 for mental health services were sort of declining year-over year so you know I think that is a challenge because if the problem we are trying to solve is mental health care for kids let's 

just start with that the way in which we're seeing it get addressed is through things like well let's just stop social media right they're now like 12 states that are requiring parental consent for social media Etc and it feels like very convenient way to improve youth mental health but some of the real problems that we're not addressing is how do we attract more people into the field number one how do we make um State lure less onerous how do we uh make uh payer credentialing much more efficient you know those are the things that are really impacting Supply that are less sexy and interesting and people aren't really talking about it as much as they're talking about social media you know those are some of the real problems and you know Matthew to go back to your original question about Supply Supply we can manage right we can control with our 

brand with how much we pay some of the pieces we can't control is how long it takes to get licensed uh in a particular State how long a pay it takes to credential etc those worry me more because they are out of my control as a founding CEO all right so uh tell me tell me the the let's go back to the for health as a business right so yes um compressed margins you you're buying a you you're selling you're selling at one price and buying another and that those two may be uncomfortably close together uh you have to build up a uh a connection with the pediatrition based on your model which do like a very clever model but requires obviously sort of boots on the ground and and getting to people to know you in each one particular Marketplace um so when you walk into a an Investor's office and say you know I'm going to build out this big Venture backal 

business um what are you what are you telling them as to how you're going to grow it to being you know the kind of thing that they want to they're going to cash their chips and go sit on their Yacht for give given these problems you just mentioned yeah um you I'm sure you had these conversations when you were raising money last year or something similar one of the uh aspects of the business that you know when you start a startup and you place bets you're never entirely sure which ones they can materialize and where you're going to need a pivot so it's sort of use your best judgment and make a few strategic decisions and then let a few months play out okay so we got really lucky because the number of the Strategic bits we made up from front have materialized so we haven't had to uh pivot we've maybe refined some of our thinking one of those was out 

go to market and it was really honestly that discussion I had with a pediatrician that made me start thinking like we can solve two problems at once one with a pediatrician that their phones are ringing off the hook and parents are calling and they don't have the resources you know to to send these these these kids to other people and and how do we solve for that and if we do it really elegantly you know that's going to solve a problem for the parents as well they're not going to be handed that sheet of paper so we went all in on that and we now have you know the factors we have like 850 salespeople in market and these are the pediatricians that are actively endorsing us actively promoting us actively referring to us um even innovating the sort of little ideas that these pediatricians have come up with are really quite remarkable because they were 

thinking about every single day how can Ford Health shave off a few more minutes right of my my or my office's Time by doing this more efficiently so they really have been amazing partners and um we avoided the very costly DTC model um we have avoided the complicated employer model uh which as you know you have to go through HR uh benefits manager you have to be large and interesting enough and you have to significantly impact utilization or or ER visits to be able to substantiate that you can reduce claims costs um and then schools well there's definitely a place for school support um there there are some concerns with that model as well because you're always subject to sort of school district budgets um and it's it's also Limited in terms of how much care you can offer these kids this it's somewhat rationed so our go to market has been very elegant 

and repeatable you know that said we have found New York's very different to New Jersey we just entered into Texas which is completely different so we have a deep appreciation for sort of the nuances in each State um so that's how we scale we have a phenomenal sales team a really good uh sales Playbook uh that's repeatable and then on the clinical side what we're really proud about is we focused uh a lot on clinical quality up front and that was through our partnership with the child mine Institute they sort of the leading kind of the gold standard in in the nonprofit space that they are based in New York so we have an exclusive partnership with them and that was the training the clinical consultation Etc to really get us of the starting block much faster than we would have if we were operating on our own um so that focused on clinical quality and 

then being able to take gold standard clinical outcomes to not only the pediatricians but also be able to Showcase those to Hospital systems and provide groups that we now have Partnerships with um really helped accelerate our progress all right so like the the the key is that you figure out a way to sell it cheaper to be grass and uh uh by by making these alliances by the by the pediatricians and and you and and you're not necessarily subject to some of the the the other types of uh of metrics that maybe tripping up some of the some of the some of the uh competitors who do some different different who gone in a different direction very interesting um so what do uh so let me ask you the final question you may or may not share this with your board or investors but you can tell me and tell the world what what does good look like for Ford Health if you 

play this out five years how many markets are you in I assume there's almost a limitless amount of demand from the kids and pediatricians but how many markets are you in uh how big do you get how what what what is good look like in the interval 5year plan um good looks like it's some of these things are going to be softer but good looks like we have not compromised on our clinical philosophy uh I don't wake up every morning to just be a matching platform um so we continue to be a leading uh employer of choice in a place that therapists really want to work uh we're enriching them we're training them Etc in terms of through an investor lens what it looks like we don't have a specific number of states it is really about at what point do we reach saturation in a market um and a little bit of that right now is driven by um the percentage of the Medicaid 

panel for each of those pediatricians um in future that is our aspiration to be in Medicaid we're primarily just in commercial right now so once we sort of hit a a SE in each of those markets will move to another Market um but you know in 5 years time I think that starts to open up some interesting windows for Partnerships possibly um Acquisitions Etc at that point it's fully proven uh you've got a model that's highly scalable and really the only thing standing in the way is is capital yeah I mean I think this has been a one of the interesting things about all of the different uh startup startup was the wrong word but new types of medical groups that I'm that uh that I've been talking about and talking with over the last few years is you know how how do you figure out we've had a traditional system where medical groups either all lied to a hospital 

because they are doing some service usually trying to stick more referrals into it so the can make money or they're now part of some big some big uh some big conglomerate or insurance company like an optim or what have you I guess you know the question is is it possible to build a an online Medical Group in this case for child and pediatric Behavioral Health you know that can replicate itself in multiple different states you know and be profitable enough that a venture capitalist will be interested in the return it's going to deliver and you know to me if you look at what's going on in some of the physical uh sort of for-profit medical groups the the news isn't always great right so um I think it's a it's a real Challenge on the other hand um and this has been you know where I think it's very interesting where you have something which is not dealt 

with well in the sort of real physical world and you know I mean access to psychiatric and mental health care for uh for kids is a great example but there are many many others you know why can't we use technology to come come up with a different approach that should allow you to scale this in a better way that enables you to both you know do good and actually do well and I guess that's the uh that's the challenge you're going to be riding for the next several years so uh you know perhaps you shouldn't have gone on that walk with a pediatrician you might have found an easier life um yeah I I'm highly confident in in our ability to scale we can sort of squint and see path to profitability and you do need to get to that sort of critical mass so that your investments in technology which we've built out a lot of our own proprietary te um begin to pay off 

so uh I look forward to having this conversation with you again in a few years and we'll have more to share but uh thank you for sharing me um letting me share a little more about about Ford Health and some of the problems we're trying to solve fantastic all right I've been doing with Natalie Schneider she is the CEO of Ford Health uh uh a relatively new player in the Pediatric and the uh child Pediatric and child pediatric is I guess behavior and mental health area Natalie thanks for your time thank you take care
