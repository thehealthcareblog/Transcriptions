Hi this is Matthew Hull with another thcv Spotlight and thrilled to have the team from lonus Health here uh named after the P character by the way I've discovered uh and we're looking for the Charlie bars football um officer I have with me left to right as you're looking at them David Bates who is the C CEO um chief medical officer Alvaro Pascal Leone who's in the middle and uh Chief product and strategy officer John shalter Alvaro is a neurologist and uh John is a primary care doc um uh David

is just a PhD so not that important but uh what they what they're here to to to talk about and show me is Li's role and Ambitions as a tester for as a testing diagnostic tool that's really trying to change how we are discovering and assessing people with uh neurological conditions dementia and and the like so they'll tell me much more about that but why don't we start with uh Alvaro you know tell us what the hell is the problem we know that dementia is a big issue and Alzheimer's is a big

issue and the rest of it but you know what why is figuring you we know lots of people have got it and we don't have any cures what's the problem that you guys are actually trying to fix well there are many problems with the way we approach it to start with contrary to to what we hope 92% of people with neurological disorders that cause cognitive problems are actually never diagnosed so so there's a large number of people who who we fail to identify those who we do identify we identify too late 

there's many years of disease process before symptoms are are recognized and by that time third problem the kind of things we can do to actually alleviate the problems are not very effective and so the situation right now is that brain related disabilities are the number one cause of disabilities worldwide more than cancer cardiovascular diseases together and worse of all that because of the way we approach it the more money we throw at it the more investment there is the more disability we 

cause rather than the more Health we promote so we need a very different approach to brain health sustaining it identifying those who are at risk of losing it enabling them to do the right thing and tracking it and that's the aspiration and goal of lonus Health to to have a real brain health care plan that that includes early diagnosis and detection of problems to enable able interventions but it also empowers individuals to do the right thing with the help of their clinicians and sustain brain 

health so John uh you're a primary care doc I assume a lot of this stuff shows up in the primary care doc World there aren't enough I assume well there AR enough Primary Care dos but there's probably not enough for sure neurologists and you know uh Specialists to figure the stuff out so what's the current state of play Primary Care do has uh a senior coming their office things are getting a bit what what happens next and now what gets done now I the current standard of care really is a referral 

to neurology a a um primary care physician that is really engaged in um brain health and cognitive impairment may do an assessment in in their own Clinic uh it's likely to be a very short assessment like a minog uh maybe possibly they're doing uh a mocha U but more likely than not there's a very short assessment that Flags uh that there's a problem and then there's a referral to neurology uh and recent clinical trials have shown that over 70% of people deteriorate in the time it takes to get to 

neurology so the state of play right now is really um not benefiting Primary Care neurology and most importantly not benefiting the patient and there really is a lack of tools um that allows primary care and primary care offices uh to step into a a good diagnostic space around cognitive impairment all right so David uh you presuming met these gents along the way somewhere decided this was an issue what's the you know overall goal and idea behind what are you trying to build technologically at line 

as health and where is it plugging into the Healthcare System yeah Matthew the overall goal is to help bring brain health into his rightful place in the global standard of care and make it accessible to everyone um and that's a lofty aspiration but it's something we believe is achievable and ab absolutely necessary what we have built is a is a suite a plat an end to end platform that really is like a turnkey software-based solution for setting up a cognitive and brain health service line in a 

health system you know you ask a lot of uh Health Care Systems some Executives you know what is your brain health strategy for 2025 and many um you know we'll admit we need one but we don't have one and that is because to date there's not really a service line for cognitive uh care it's just as as Alo and John alluded to it's really they show up complaints maybe do an assessment maybe not refer to neurology um and and whatever options are available from there but we intend to change that and some 

of the fundamental principles of our um capability and What Makes Us unique is you know the the premise that um behavior is the primary observable output of the brain and if we can use uh sensors and advanced algorithms to um assess Behavior especially a prescribed Behavior at present um you can effectively um understand what's going on in the brain and you can scale certain time intensive and aspects of a specialist like Alvaro um using the technology and so you can get a clinical impression on that 

individual in a very short period of time and give primary care doctors like John uh insights into what's going on with the brain what's my next step how do I work them up check for depression check meds do an antol energic burden calculation uh sleep apnea you know so on and so forth what uh to order and then when when Alvaro gets it he has a full package work up he can review it he can replay the assessment he can hear it he can send out additional assessments if he wants to he can in coordination 

with John generate a care plan and a monitoring plan that's personalized to the individual so that they can carry out uh an action plan by themsel or together with a care partner to optimize their quality of life and indeed their their uh U prognosis um and and preserve Independence as much as possible and as John said you know especially at the MCI State early MCI stabilized that what's MCI mild cognitive impairment okay great question I clearly have that because I don't I don't but at the mogni 

impairment is not yet affecting their daily life they can still have a good quality of life but they need to be managed uh in a way that that preserves that quality of life and they don't progress hopefully to dementia let me right so before we dive into and you're going to show me how this works and how it fits into the workflow but the very precise question maybe not for you maybe for uh for Alo is you got that the the the fear about people you know dementias or or calling of any kind is you go 

well it's happening to me what the hell can I do about it and I know there are people selling supplements online and telling you testosterone or whatever but is there stuff we can actually do to delay or ameliorate um mild impairment yes that's a great question so so there's many things we can do to start with we can prepare ourselves which is which is no small thing actually is one of the things that people say would be most valuable to them if there was a test that they could do that that anticipates 

whether they're going to have problems on the road they would live differently and that alone would be of value but but even without that or even ahead of that we can actually prescribe um personalized interventions that actually make a difference and they start with lifestyle modifications that together can reduce the risk of potential progression towards Dementia by 40 to 80% that that makes a huge difference but but it doesn't work if you start too late right so part of the challenge is to maintain 

your brain health to prevent the problems to begin with and on top of it we now have medications we have medications that actually for specific diseases go at the root of the pathology and clean up reduce the burden of that pathology and make a big difference in terms of the risk of disease progression so there is some of you can do so it's worth figuring out what it is and I assume that if you get it early and you can prevent it you know down the road you're saving potentially saving a lot of not only 

pain and suffering but money right that's exactly right I mean we're in a very similar place that were with diabetes or with many forms of cancer some decades ago where we came to realize that if you identify the problem early and you intervene early which means if you don't wait for the specialist in all instances but actually Empower Primary Care Providers to do the right thing with the patients in ahead of time before complications develop that you can actually prevent the complications and and and 

that's what we need to do with with brain health prevent the complications and disabilities that come from diseases that may lead to Dementia or may lead to to substantial impairment on what age should people start taking this test in general if you going to put it in all PCP sort of General workflow yeah I think at this point probably in the 50s I think ultimately hopefully earlier than than that but but I think but early enough for long in life the people shouldn't be you know you should be starting 

to pick stuff up and then does that answer very if it's a presidential candidate or current president don't answer that question don't answer that all right so let's so let's let's take a look and see what the actual test looks like okay so you're going to show me what the uh the actual experience looks like um and I think you as a primary care doct joh is sending an email so what happens next yeah so I I I chose an assessment for David to do before he came in for his visit he got an email uh he clicks 

on on start assessment and then it launches him directly into his assessment all right um assessment start go ahead and cons send him and then we test the system I can hear it hello hear it hello all right I would like you to pretend that you are going shopping I am going to read a list of things you need to buy when I am finished reading the whole list I will ask you to say the words back to me in any order press the start button when you are ready to begin the words are pineapple drill stapler cantaloupe 

eraser pliers please say the words back to me now in any order pineapple drill stapler cantaloupe pliers eraser now I am going to read the shopping list again when I am finished reading the whole list I will ask you to say the words back to me in any order press the start button when you are ready to begin the words are pineapple drill stapler cantaloupe eraser pliers please say the words back to me now in any order pineapple drill stapler pantalone eraser pineapple pliers in this task you will be shown a 

category then you will name as many items in the category for example if the category is flowers you might say Rose tulip you will have one minute to name as many items from the category as you can remember to say them out loud press start when you are ready to begin monkey giraffe lion rhinoceros crocodile alligator Cayman iguana parrot toucan Eagle bear wolf coyote orangutang rattlesnake boa constrictor python shark Orca barracuda trout Seabass Antelope deer moose Grizzly Ram cat dog goldfish penguin 

Turtle your one minute is up you have have completed this task now you will hear five numbers after listening to all of them repeat the numbers backwards if you hear 1 4 2 7 5 you would say five 7 2 4 1 let's begin with a practice 2 8 4 9 6 6 9 4 8 2 if you said 6 9 4 8 2 you are correct you will do this three times you can retry the practice or tap start to begin eight 2 3 1 6 6 1 3 2 8 4 8 7 9 1 1 9 7 8 4 2 5 4 6 9 9 6 5 4 2 please say the words from the shopping list in any order pineapple wrench eraser 

cantaloup drill stapler now you will see groups of three words for each group please choose which word was on the shopping list press the start button when you are ready to begin which word was on the shopping list peaches pineapple oranges which word was on the shopping list Hammer Nails drill which word was on the shopping list stap pencil envelopes which word was on the shopping list strawberries Apple cantaloupe which word was on the shopping list paper eraser stamps which word was on the shopping list 

pliers wrench screwdriver that's the the end of the test and they're able to provide feedback if they had any difficulties or or struggles so so that that's that's great so that's you know I I guess Al there's like a particular part of the the assessment the look sort of verbal recall is what you're trying to do here I don't know I think uh you know John you that far too well you're not you're not as dumb as the rest of us cuz I could remember any of the shopping list by the time they got back to it either 

that you've been practicing for this test which you shouldn't really be doing but Alber what what I mean before we go to look at the answers what's what's going on there in terms of is there a specific part of you know um early on set dimensional or what have you that does verbal stuff compared to visual because there was some visual stuff right on the test and I know there are a bunch of other companies that have done maybe you in this as well have done visual type tests where you have to draw a squiggly 

line or you know or or move something into a house you know move some some stuff around so what else do you have what else did you not show us so yeah it's a great question so so there are over 30 different assessments that that we can we can do and they capture different aspects of the brain function um this one is particularly suited for remote assessment as John was saying because you you send it to somebody and you can capture the performance in addition to capturing by voice metrics a number of different 

aspects that have to do with mood with oh you assessing are you assessing the voice Biometrics as well as as part of this okay interesting so we're we're you know one of the things that we do that is different from other companies is that we we measure not just the outcome of the task but the process by which you go about doing it and that's called process evaluation or B process method and because it was started here and and what technology does is capture the way in this case David was going about doing the 

task and we could do the same if it was a drawing task so so if so if he was uh slowing or he was sort of stuttering or he was struggling to get the words out but got them right it would change the score compared to like the ra the way did it that's right so quite different to say was pliers part of the list or or if you say pliers for example it automatically picks that kind of stuff up yeah it does and and so there there's hesitations there's latencies there are pauses there are timings there are voice and 

language metrics the the second thing to your question is that these are tasks that are very well known very well established cognitive neuroscience and neuros psychology and they tap different different cognitive functions different domains you know in order to to think of animals for example you you need to tap into different subcategories and and you could see that in in in David right he was he was getting rolling with deer and moose and and then sort of shifted to fish and did a few and then shift to 

house ped and did a few and and we can measure not just how many words you how many animals you come up with but also how closely or far away from a semantic point of view these these different elements these different animals named are are to each other so we can get a lot of insight into the the function of the brain by looking at great detail in the into the cognitive processes involved the tasks that he did fundamentally tap into encoding and retrieval of memory that was the first one something called the 

Philadelphia verbal learning task and and has been very well established and and we we can tap on how quickly his brain is learning a new list and how well it retrieves it immediately and also how well it retrieves it after a delay and whether or not he recognizes the items and that TS very speciic specifically on memory systems and those are the first ones often times affected in illnesses like Alzheimer's disease so very sensitive measure of of it then the verbal fluency it's a very sensitive measure of 

more frontal systems but because of the semantic nature is the interaction between frontal and temporal areas very specific temporal areas in the brain and can can help sort out things like Alzheimer's diseas has differential diagnosis from frontal dementias or frontal temporal dementias and in somebody young like David that's what John was thinking about it's like let me make sure that I differentiate these potential neurod degenerative diseases and then the digit span the repeating of the numbers will assess 

attention but also will assess executive function the ability to keep track of things in a proper order to retrieve them to put them backwards in order and get give them back and that's a very sensitive measure for frontal systems that might be affected in many things including depression and anxiety disorders but also little strokes or illnesses like like dementia producing degenerative diseases so it's a very quick but very comprehensive assessment of the brain state so so a couple of quick followup questions 

for you and for John for John so you know how often is it you you you mentioned I think that 92% of people never get diagnosed how how often are people now getting this type of assessment in their day-to-day or general you know if everyone over 50 should get it how I mean I've never had one from other than other than the one that uh that David gave me in a bar which but yeah uh seriously I mean I you know I don't know how often these should be described as you know like your colon test or whatever the hell that you

know you should you come last week you should be getting at ag5 whatever it is so number one how often is it happening and B you know has that been a problem that you couldn't scale them because these were done on paper and now if we have this type of tool we can we can scale them much more often and then the second question is what what do I see as what what is John or the neurologist what does who get back on the professional clinical side yeah so to to answer your your first question the uh status quo um is

this testing is not getting done uh we might be doing a mini Cog uh but that is not nearly as sensitive as something like the test that we just we just did and and only about 20 or percent or so of primary care providers are are actually using test right and they know they should but they they are not using that pres because they have to do it in their office or they have to somebody in office do it on paper or and it's a right you have to suddenly repeat the words and you know it's just not done

automatically yeah so this takes staff time time um the administration of a test like this is typically done by a psychometrician um a neurologist or a neural psychologist uh the Linus clinical Suite skills up the entire Primary Care staff to be able to administer these which is one of the key features of of the system U and what we're looking at now uh is the uh is what the primary care physician sees so as ELO said there's all kinds of really deep analysis that neurologists do on this that that neuros

psychologists do on this uh really what primary care is looking for is how do they compare to their peers are they red yellow green uh so we take the you know the immediate recall uh David did great he got six out of six the first time five out of six the next time um and then we moved him on to that semantic fluency he named 32 words again this was all scored um in the background uh in the cloud it's presented to to me as a Primary Care do is a score of uh of 32 um and then also back to some of that

process measures you know how how did he do in the in each 15c block was he did he stay pretty stable this is what he ran out of animals to talk about R out so you know R running out above 32 um is great you know in this um particular um case the uh the the score wasn't adjusted for the education level because we don't have all the details in uh in the this fake patient um but we end up with percentiles this would be well in the 90th percentile um moved on to the backward digit span now this performance was in

the the top quartile you know David did uh miss two of putting them in the right order which is perfectly normal um you know this these again are very challenging tests and we're looking for for evidence of of impairment but you know back to that process he did name you know all all 15 numbers but got two of them two of them out of order and with all of the voice and speech you can go back and listen to uh what was actually done you can see how long it took him to uh to complete those and then as Alvaro said we get into the

delayed recall uh and you know 93rd percentile I remembered five out of six uh but then when he went to the delayed recognition actually got six out of six uh so you know slightly easier with that prompting to pick off the list of three uh and you can really see in patients a a difference between when they do poorly on the delayed recall un prompted and the recover back up to um six out of six and can give you some additional indication of uh you know is this more executive memory you know mixed um but

from a primary care standpoint I can quickly come through um and look at these I can go through and see you know which which they picked off the list to understand where the where the confusion was uh and very excitingly in the uh we if we had done this next week uh we actually would have also included our new summary report so the new thing we're we're introducing is our summary report um that's based around uh cognitive domains and really providing uh Advanced insights for the primary care physicians uh to 

understand based upon those tests that we just took that alvare was talking about um how was their executive function how is their you know their planning part of the brain how is their language how you know how well are they able to to speak and process words what is their their memory and learning that classic Alzheimer's disease um profile and symptom uh and then again that complex attention and understanding the uh amount of effort and work that it takes to pay attention to these seven minutes uh and understanding 

which area of of the brain is a is a problem can really accelerate the referral really accelerate the diagnosis and and bring an understanding of you know do I need to dig into depression or could this be somebody with undiagnosed ADHD that has an attention problem that's driving driving the other testing but this uh type of cognitive domain analysis uh typically requires referrals typically require six to nine months to get uh and we're going to be able to bring it to the primary care physicians almost in real time 

so you know in less than 60 seconds of of processing this will be available inside the EHR for primary care physicians to take action against go ahead alra sorry if I may the goal is um is to optimize the care for the patient and the resources right it's not about not getting the patients to the neurologist but it's actually getting those patients to the neurologist that really need me now and and and and not not book up my time with patients who have actions that can be taken by a primary care provider to effectively 

address the problems so can we can we talk about that process just a little bit so you come in I see this person has got you know some bad scores uh this is not the the summary of what uh uh uh uh uh David just because he's got a PhD from some fancy University and isn't old and dumb yet like me but this is this is a markup of somebody who has got problems and these referrals right so I see this as a primary care doctor I'm using your system what do I do next let's say is there a thing saying you know flashing red light 

you might want to refer this person and here is who you refer it to what's the sort of next part of the workflow to get them to Al and his Clinic yeah so very excitingly and and one of the things that we've been waiting on to bring this forward is the clinical decision support that underlines the these cognitive domains and what to do uh with different patterns of cognitive domain impairment because uh it's really important to get the right people FastTrack to neurology uh you know but if again leaning on complex attention 

if complex attention was as a driver I really need to look at sleep problems sleep apnea depression um treated ADHD all of which doesn't need to go to Alvaro if it's identified that there's depression let's treat the depression and retest if if there's if you took this and you were not on your ADHD medication let's get you're on your ADHD medication to retest know let's not just re KNE jerk send you to neurology um but there's a a cognitive domain based clinical decision support uh that goes along with along with this that 

Alvaro and and our medical team here have done an awesome job on and and and I think we just to to emphasize the importance of that we we have not just generated it but vetted it with experts that have reviewed it and agreed and applied and obtain approval at the European Community for those decision supports which are regulated in Europe in a different way than than here actually stricter so that to your point Matthew what we want to offer clinicians are our actionable recommendations that don't leave them wondering what 

the heck does this score mean but rather unpacks it in explicit suggestions of considering don't dictate what they do but but we remind them of of of things that they could test for that they may want to consider asking for additional testing before just referring the patient or guiding in their decision okay so uh that's great you've got the things that you keep it on board you keep you got the people you you refer out um so let's let's flip over to the sort of the business end of this um and and maybe ask ask ask you David 

so there have been a bunch of people who who've done neurological testing and there's been people who've gone you know raised money and then gone out of business and what there's a bit of a history here why is it kind of the right time it makes a lot of sense right makes a lot of sense in the world um for the reason you said as Al Al discussed earlier in the uh in the conversation there are things you can do I suspect the thing you should do is better die and more exercise because that's the same thing you do for everything 

it's the same as diabetes or whatever but but whatever the thing you do or you know play Soko or whatever the whatever the answer is um how you know and yes as a we have a lot of olderly people we don't have enough neurologist obviously you know this should become something that gets done but how are you going to get this into the hands of primary care docs where's that demand you know coming from or how do you stimulate that demand or educate them about that demand how do you get systems to to make this something that should 

happen because obviously it's kind of been tried before and hasn't really made it so how do you get there when some of the others who've been you know doing this before you have maybe they did it wrong maybe it was the wrong timing maybe it was just you know luck or whatever but uh H how how do you get  this to work yeah I mean that's that's the real question question um so I think that you know those who've gone before us um they probably were ahead of the market uh because in a lot of people's a lot of Physicians 

consideration you know there's nothing they could do about cognitive issues and so it wasn't sought after because it's just tell people they got a problem and you know um there's no solution offered um that all as we know is changing and it's changing rapidly both the emergence of new therapies uh such as the disease modifying therapies from ASI and Lily and soon to come from others as well as you know non-invasive interventions like TMS or current stimulation or or neurom modulation and also um you know we're all hopeful that 

the gp1s will show benefit uh at preventing dementia and uh lastly and has been shown empirically is a lifestyle modification and ProActive Management of chronic illnesses can prevent um progression to dementia for for many of those suffering with mild cognitive impairment and so now that there's a a padr of of of treatment options and there's advancements in detection options um the timing is now especially with an aging population the business models all worked out so it's really you know those Health Systems and we're 

partnering with many who are uh proactive in hey the brain is super important to this population actually the control center of the human is really where Health uh you know arises from and a healthy brain is a healthy person um and so you know we're really hopeful that more and more systems put this at the top of their list it's it's in all you know dementia is in the top five um major causes but but it's actually it affects um both people with hypertension and diabetes they're at very high risk and the worst hypertensive or 

diabetic patient is an undiagnosed uh hypertensive or diabetic patient because they don't remember their meds they don't remember their care and they're the hardest ones the most costly ones they're the ones that end up in the ER and having knowledge about their brain health and a service line to manage them is the way to uh really promote health and to reduce cost of care and to accurately understand especially those under value based care you know what is the risk of your population are you being uh are you coding accurately 

those folks and are you managing them and offering them the right Services uh to care for their condition and prevent um you know advancement of the illness as much as possible so can let me let me let me point you a bit about that you said the business model is ready for now um back and forth what what when you go to either a health system or an insurer or what have you what are they saying you know this is a good idea um and yes it may prevent people getting dementia down the road or impr Works worsening their hypertension or 

whatever um are they actually in with you you know how close a lot of people go and say week I mean I was talking to a pediatric company the other day just on my on my blog last week and they were you know they're explaining how they wraparound Pediatrics thing saves saves year visits you know from kids who get their feeding tube messed up in the middle of the night and I get that this is a little bit down the path right you trying to tell me that you're going to save the money are they able to bill for this in a way they couldn't 

before what's the what's the thing that are switching on and saying yes we will we will work with you here whereas as I said some of your competitor predecessor companies and the space of had trouble getting adopted yeah so it's actually um all of the above I mean the fee for service model is pretty straightforward uh CMS does have a billing pathway that begins with the assessment to the kind of evaluation of the results of that assessment and communication with the patient all the way to uh the cognitive assessment and Care 

planning for people who have diagnosed uh cognitive issues and there's a very clear billing pathway there as well as on the um the downstream revenues so filling those MRI machines the The Specialist Services the blood panels um you know the pharmacy at the hospital especially with these infusions and other medications um so there's there's an economic pathway there that's that has a a strong Roi as well as you know on the value based side you know you're bearing the risk of this population your incidence diagnosed incidence 

is probably fraction of what your true incidence is and they're not you don't know who they are but they're showing up in the ER they're not taking their medication their cost is going up and if you would just identify them you would be accurately coding your risk adjustment factors and also a study came out of Ashner that showed you know just by managing their their dementia you're saving $475 per member per month so there is the on the revenue side accurate Raph is important because you are bearing that risk and on the uh 

management side it is massive cost reduction um for for for handling those patients and importantly um satisfaction patient satisfaction caregiver satisfaction when they are being uh engaged around their brain health and provided access to services to promote their own brain health and to get the education to be able to have that quality of life they are satisfied they are seeking that information and so your quality scores go up so you're reducing readmissions you're reducing all these things in management you're getting 

compensated for the risk you're bearing and most importantly you are affecting for the better the lives of your members of the patients you're serving and that's really the proposition and from there their diabetes is better managed their hypertension is better managed you know you go on COPD chronic heart failure get the flavor so so let me ask you the the the so you you can walk into the fever service in Fever service land and say hey which is great and by the way we're going to bump up you know a bunch of the stuff that 

you're doing and make you get you know your neurologists need to be Fuller with the more you with patients who really need them or what have you and by the way you might sell some more MRIs and whatever and you can go to the value based care you know at risk folks and say we're going to save you somebody down the line how's it working who's picking it up the fastest and uh tell me where you are as a company now with Hospital Systems Health FS give me a sense of the uh the flavor yeah so um we are servicing uh we're partnering 

with a number of Health academic Medical Center Health System and and Community Health Systems large um care delivery organizations um as well as you know many many you know hundreds of physician practices and um neurology uh clinics as well as coner clinics um you know and we're actually in Europe serving some of their private Hospital Systems uh we're in the UK um so we're really it's who either they have a a senior population or they have taken a proactive stance on brain health because they know it reson it resonates 

with the population you know V28 which is the new you know issuance of of of Medicare um it is gearing more towards brain health services and reducing a little bit towards you know the the hypertension the diabetes but increasing on the brain health side so the the the the Winds of Change are here and they're all in favor I would say of of brain health and I think um those who are proactive in you know really like we we this is the number one concern for patients over 55 for people over 55 that they would get dementia the 

surveys have all showed it's everyone wants information they all want to know what's going on you know 90 something percent they want to know about the brain health what they can do how they can avoid dementia they want to be engaged by their Primary Care concerning their brain health um and they want to find um solutions they want to find education and the systems that are on the um on the move are the ones that are going to be focusing on brain health in the coming years even at Davos this year just last in January they 

said this is a priority brain health is a priority worldwide uh it it matters so much of course to prevent Illness but also productivity in society cost to society you know it's either a net gain in goods and services to people with good brain health or it's a detraction because they're suffering sure so uh let me push you back how many uh how many systems are you in today and how many do you think you're going to be in or in in call it two years I mean how how is this uptake you're talking a good game how is the uptake 

actually happening and how many how many patients are you touching now and how many you going to be touching shortly um yeah so probably what a dozen Health Systems um and uh like I said you know couple 150 maybe clinical practices I think we just crossed 200 200 clinical practices uh hundreds of doctors obviously maybe thousands across that um and patients uh I think tens and tens of thousands we we can actually look at across the country um maybe maybe it's more than that um and then you said how many do you hope at the 

end of this year I hope we have uh you know dozens and dozens approaching a hundred Health Systems um and hundreds of thousands of patients I want to get to Millions next year I mean yeah you have you have you know um whatever it is you know 100 million people over 55 in this country alone so you should big big Target to go for that's great all right real quick on the uh on the company um you've been around uh how many years and you raised a ton of a decent chunk of money but a while back just give me some of the metrics of the 

comp of how you long you've been around how many people how much you raised how many people you got and where you are in that kind of startup cycle yeah I mean we've been around for 5 and a half years the first uh four three and a half years were spent um developing the platform working with Pharma partners and serving research so we're running lots of clinical trials lots of research studies building out the platform we went into our first clinics in the late 2023 um and then we went into our first Health Systems in early 2024 

and we've really just been working working with them to perfect the Enterprise offering and now we're we're scaling that up moving into the payers moving into serving uh payers because we have uh you know we can engage consumers through their their uh applications um so that's where we are from a commercialization we continue to work with lots of leading Pharma companies on their clinical trials um we are working with to show to see if the drugs screwing people out cognitively as they go and through clinical trials right 

essentially I think they they appreciate the the ease of administration uh the low participant burden and the accuracy of the assessment and so they see thousands of metrics and they get a much greater objective picture into what's going on with the brain function and the response to therapy but but you're but you're assuming that I'm assuming from this conversation you think that the general care pattern of care and health systems are going to be the main venue for for that's be the main venue as well as you know outside 

of the clinic engagement connected to the clinic right so the doctor is always in the loop but because of the the constraints of time being able to engage outside the clinic being able to engage in the clinic and then go with the pent patient bringing back the monitoring in progress how they're doing being able to readjust plans meds whatever's necessary to optimize brain health outcomes um so that's on that side um we have we did our series B uh round of funding in 2021 um we do expect to do our series C this year um and 

looking to really um use that raise to accelerate growth and our ability to serve the population we have a a super exciting road map as you as you can imagine with all the advances in Ai and with our digital platform you know you need digital in order to do Advanced Ai and so um we're well positioned to help health systems and payers and or such organizations really take advantage of the Innovations coming forth and serving patients um with with Better Health Care more efficiently at at scale and with Equity so everyone 

can access them and I think that's really the power of the Innovations and technologies that we're bringing to Market yeah well said so I think uh we'll we'll wrap it there we've had a good a good long look into both the business of line itself but also how the technology actually works which is I think Super exciting and you know yeah this is one of those things where it'll probably be like you know getting your class checks every year or whatever you you wonder why you didn't do it before and it probably wasn't medical 

standard the practice and now it should be in you know with as you said the impact of all this stuff the fact we can do something something about it um and the fact that it's you know a relative I won't ask you about pricing but a relatively cheap uh initial test that can be scaled because of the technology we have you know uh it's what one things to be done I look forward to seeing you guys go to the mat and get those millions of people on the system as soon as we can right okay I've been talking with John Sho is the chief 

product of us uh uh Alvaro Pasqual Leone who is the chief medical officer and David Bates the CEO who's somehow disappeared off the camera I don't this works camera you guys have you have to say something someone disappeared outline herself J thanks for your time really interesting to Capt up with you and see what you are doing thanks thanks for your time today thanks so much so much thank you!
