[Music] Matthew hold I'm here with Bevy Miner old friend who is now the uh these days the EVP of healthc care strategy and policy for consensus car Solutions um baby we're going to talk about you know last mile to last few yard uh interoperability and data sharing for people who don't have access to a lot of data um so you guys are in the business of putting unstructured data into a more structured format and deliberate to the right place um a lot of people don't have EMR don't have fire but they do

have fax machines and that's kind of Bustin consensus in so tell me briefly what you do and what problem you're fixing so consensus Clause Solutions Flagship product is eax we're the largest in healthcare faxing we also recognize that faxing is unstructured data it is the easiest way to send and receive it's still unstructured data when you think about send and receive very secure interoperability is a receiving problem many of our customers receive an unstructured fact a PDF they've got

scanned images you can't do anything with that data if it's really unstructured it's still data it's still a lot of consumption you can still attach it to something but many times it requires data entry to pull out anything that is relevant so who's using what types of organizations are you talking about how are they currently using it and why do they need it to be more structured and better and whatever you know why does it require the things that you were about to tell me how you what you do to it so

I'm going to give an example you've got a patient that's leaving an acute facility as a a hospital and they are being discharged with part of their care into a substance abuse facility that substance abuse facility did not get an EHR under meaningful use CMS didn't give them the funds so they are lacking in an ability to have any kind of longitudinal record they can receive a fact many of our our customers substance abuse critical access Hospital Community clinics um they get an eax but they have

to data enter it they have to put it into their system of record when that data can be unstructured so we pull out all the demographics we pull out all of the medications we pull out the treatment and we send that as a structured format and we can map it into any kind of system that the substance abuse clinics may have the community clinics Or the critical access hospitals that's really important many times the hospitals if they're an epic Hospital they're going to move forward with buer

and tea they're going to they're going to send a fire message to the substance abuse Clinic to the Community Clinic to rural health they can digest a a fire message so when I say interoperability is a receiving problem we have to recognize who's receiving it how can they manage data should it be pulled out of of an unstructured document so they can be consumed on the on the receiving end many of those care settings that I just mentioned their lifeblood they live off of referrals and we've even heard that

larger Hospital systems are not going to be sending referrals unless the trading partner can absorb something that is more structured we translate that in the middle we allow the entire system to connect so that patients that are vulnerable that are in our underserved markets their records and their data can follow them so one is that the your end customer or those sort of uh you know post nonstandard non-acute hospitals you know uh can use can can can exist to get the data get the referrals eventually

get paid what else can if if you structure the data for them what else can they do can they a get paid more can they do different stuff for those patients can they transfer that data in a different way back to other uh Services those patients might need how does this improve their world and the world for the patients it's a great it's a great it's a great question let's just take I I gave you an example of referrals yeah um and referral is going to Specialty we got to get the referral to the

specialist really fast because they've got to raise their hand and say I can take that patient so there are some systems we've even talked to where they have 8,000 different kinds of referrals coming in in a given month and there's somebody having to go through them by the time they get to the patients the patients have't moved on so FASTT tracking those referrals so the data can be structured you can look at levels of Acuity of the patient let's just take home health well Home Health can't

always raise their hand and say yeah I can take that patient you need to really understand what kind of treatment has to be done then raise your hand and say yes I can take I can take that patient we're we're discharging people at much higher levels of Acuity into care settings that aren't going to be interoperable referrals is one thing prior authorization come January 1st of 2027 if you are going to do a prior authorization for a Medicare Advantage patient you have to send that as fire or

X12 to the payer many of those organizations can't do that they can send a fax to us that's a prior authorization times it's handwritten as urgent written across the top our AI technology that product is called Clarity that extracts all this our AI technology can extract all the pertinent information from that that prior authorization and it can send it as a fire message so now all of these different care settings can participate in in in rules that are very daunting and herculine for them to try and

Achieve referrals and prior authorizations are a couple use cases that our customers use all the time because they also are the two that are really problematic with unstructured data and a lot of data so uh you are also a policy person you've been hanging out in Washington DC uh I know it's we're here in early March 2025 and God knows what's happening to the wider world of policy even within Healthcare but youve got a little bit of data about how big a problem this is for your clients and what CIO think about it

so tell us about the study you did so we did a study with chime to ask how are you allowed to mention Chim hims I'm not sure anymore I not okay yet another reason why you make it so yeah Collective voice piece of CI for hospitals an organization that does that um and we asked how important is Health Equity because when I look at this um I look at the Patients journey and it is an equity Journey it's a it's a journey that patients treated in some of those underserved markets those providers

don't have the same access to the Solutions in the large Metropolitan idn so we asked them how important is Health Equity well 54% said it's very important for them because those patients are going to bounce back sure into the hospital admitted readmitted May don't get paid for and all kinds of stuff they're going to get readmitted there's going to be a readmission issue to deal with um and they're under value based care you don't want those patients to come back and of the time is if the data

isn't there for the provider to treat them the right way Health Equity has to equal tecken Equity so we have got to do the lowest level of digital maturity but make it relevant and make it useful and digital Cloud faxing does that lowest level of secure way to exchange information with our Clarity product we make that datal useful so 54% of those we surveyed said it was very important to them and 42% said it's it's somewhat important so that's a big percentage now is that because all the

cios and the CEOs of Hospital Systems you know have a heart or an altruistic way of saying oh we need to do things with Health Equity no they're coming from a standpoint of of Revenue of um remediation of um patient care and the expenses of patient care so it's costing a lot of money and when we ask questions of We did an hfma uh webinar just recently and we talked about the cost of not treating patients as some of these care settings with the same level of equity I mean even when you think about

population health so if the cdc's data modernization is is requiring that everything get populated using fire and some of these places cannot from a surveillance standpoint send fire to the Registries for the CDC that's biased data it's automatically going to be biased it's going to be biased for research because you're sitting over here with a huge amount of unstructured data that nobody wants wants to really touch they just think they can start with structured data here at hyms

there's a lot of vendors that have ai Solutions their sweet spot and their Solutions and their workflow tools work great once the structure data when I drill a little bit bu more and I talked to a lot of these partners of ours too what do you do with all of that structure data well they have somewhat of a solution but they don't want to touch it because it's the good stuff it's the stuff that's not really useful in a lot of things we're seeing at him that's our sweet spot we

can touch it we can do something with it and then we can put it into any kind of workhow solution so you're abled for an substance abuse clinic or CRI access or whoever has not got the that set of tools you can basically they can send a you can they can take a fact that you've created structur data world put it into their system they can send a fact that you can do the reverse of if they hav we've got an exchange translation solution that takes all that data there's the highway that we can connect

and then how much room do you think there is so if you go back to like the the people who are now talking about delivering uh AI based communication systematic patients delivering you know uh extraction of care gaps got what all the multiple stuff you're hearing about you know for the for those people from that mess messy unstructured data how much room do you think there is for improvement at the kind of clients that you're working with as compared to you know HCA TR to drive down operating cost

by 2% or whatever they're doing with with their you know with that kind of ambient Ambient AI installations so I think there's a tremendous amount of value and the example I gave you is patient discharge from maybe a large idn down to a you know a vulnerable area of rural Health but we've had a lot of conversations over 400 conversations of people that have stopped by our booth here at himy just on day one and we were learning a lot about the applicability of the solutions that we're talking about if

you got a hospital large Hospital on Epic trying to discharge patients to a point plate care Skilled Nursing Facility yeah they don't talk to each other the the patient shows up in the Skilled Nursing Facility hours later the medications they need to be on the treatment that they need to have and that continuity is absolutely important so even though we have sophisticated systems not everyone is going to be epic to Epic to Epic it'll it's a big part of the pie but we have to recognize that

care delivery is happening in a whole bunch of other other care City we work with payers a lot of the payers are saying we need to get structured data so that we can FastTrack those prior authorizations and we can also do the Urgent one they're they're actually one of our biggest customers and thinking about the CMS rule because they have only 72 hours to return a Medicare Advantage prior authorization if it's urgent they need that data in a structured format too so we're not going

to get rid of we're hoping to get rid of the papera machine that's happening more and more and more consensus is a publicly traded company and we have great growth in our faxing solution a lot of it is also movement to the cloud nobody wants to have on Prem servers and fax servers so moving to the cloud getting rid of the paper fax machine we now know that we can leap even over that that unstructured factor document so how much of what you're talking about so you take the the facts documents so now you're a document you

can do stuff with the document document could be exchanged you know using fact technology but you can do extraction stuff out of it the other thing that I'm seeing a lot of is people discussing using voice to voice because there's a lot of people in call centers dealing with some of these issues as well and you not star and see voice agents on both sides to to talk to each other how much do you think that is either something part of what you're going to get into to or a threat to your business

or is that kind of not so relevant you know when you think about the various ways of of communicating the Omni Channel ways um so there's going to be SMS there's going to be voice to voice we we don't do anything with extraction technology unless it's in a textual format but there's always transcripts there's transcripts with with all of these calls and our generative AI can can package summaries of what what exactly are we hearing from a particular transcript that came from voice or

transcripts that may be pulling out soap notes or whatever it might be we are not using our AI for any clinical decision support for any kind of treatment support we augment that by taking data that helps inform a treatment that helps inform a diagnosis we don't um pull um irregular lab results or out of range lab results but our gen AI can have a rule put in place that says give me all of my patients that have hemoglobin A1c that went from 5.6 to 6.5 and now the AI knows all right let me look for those

kinds of ranges and we can summarize that data coming from some of the voice technology but it has to be in a a textual format we don't do ambient listening we don't do any of that kind of stuff yeah I'm and I'm just wondering how the what you're talking about is a nonstructured to nonstructured data and there are still people calling you know receptionists at Medical groups and places calling you know about prior all from whatever talking to somebody who's looking for a paper manual on the other

end you know and there which is the analogy of facts to facts right I'm just W about about how much of all that stuff you know you you discussed the method how does that get structured you take the transcripts you figure out you know how do you how do you do the same thing you're doing with facts is how do you extract information out of the facts and then start running tools over the top of it and I guess my quest my wider question it's going to yes answer is how much capacity do we have for

improving these parts of healthcare that have been very inefficient right and been been very expensive and where patient care has been compromised because stuff fall through those gaps all the time and what's your sense do we make this a lot better quite quickly using tools like yours I think we have made it in the use cases and the proof of concepts with our customers we've made it a lot better but a lot of a lot of the answers you have to have is where we see the the improvements what metrics

are we using for measurement you have 200 people that are sitting there reading prior authorizations all the time just looking for the Urgent ones getting them into some sort of a process for you know denial approval and we know the American people have have said with large headlines all over the place that we have to change this prior authorization process so we have to do something about it they are the constituents the voters for those people on that you know represent our lawmakers there is going to be some movement

towards what we're going to do about this and we just have to get rid of a lot of that data entry and and fast tracking how long does it take great metric how long does it take to find an urgent prior authorization when it used to take this long and it used to take 200 people to do it the other piece is revenue you get referrals that are sitting down you you know not being addressed the system is losing Revenue opportuni so it's really what are we trying to measure and if we just set out

to just put in I you AI for AI sake and do all the cool bells and whistles without real metrics of measurement it's not going to be adopted as fast and you know Matthew you and I have have known each other for a long time whenever we've seen a technology in healthcare that is looking for a problem to solve it doesn't usually work right except two years ago at himy AI big announcements Microsoft epic together are going to do generative AI we're going to help diagnose and everybody was thinking oh

that's the craziest thing we've heard the AI is going to diagnose a patient what if the AI gets it wrong and the patient dies that was 2 years ago and a year ago at H you know the injury C was like yeah this kind of has some validity to it but what do hell do we do with this stuff there were questions and Hospital systems are like we kind of have an AI strategy but we really don't know where to deploy it now it HS just 3 years later a technology that was looking to solve a problem is solving

problems all over the place with measurable ways they are solving problem and that's what I think the industry did right is to say look I'm a hospital system I'm not going to just buy this stuff just to buy it I need to know what is it going to affect and that's the fastest example I have ever seen of a technology trying to solve a problem that at least in healthcare is really solving problems fantastic well do with BBY Miner from consensus CL Solutions B always great to catch up with you and

find out what you're thinking okay thanks for your time thanks
