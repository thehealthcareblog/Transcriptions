[Music] all right Matthew Hol old friend of the JCB family Jonathan Bush uh late of a Seena health for those of you have a certain vintage and now uh not quite CEO for rent but uh gentlemen uh Zeus health I'm teaching deep passionate zeuser I'm a zeuser in my cor yourself okay all I was I was just practicing everything prac before I don't what's it I don't remember what is it was some kind of obstetric Clinic with a we love them very much we all right all right and they're still going

in the whole new guys blah blah blah blah blah but Zeus uh taking data from multiple sources and presenting it in front of whom for what purpose Zeus is and always on fire native API first medical record when we say EMR today what we really mean is sort of this rub Goldberg recordkeeping contraption yeah that clicks captures the clicks that you clicked when you were seeing a patient and it does a wonderful job I that you can use those clicks to demonstrate that you deserve a 99215 instead of a 214 whatever whatever um but as our payment

model migrates now to risk contracts with quality measures knowing the whole picture of the patient not just the part that that you clicked is increasingly important you know short term it's like make sure you get the full risk adjustment you're entitled to make sure you hit your quality measures but long term it's like actually steer the patient to the right place right actually grab them in the moment when you're most useful not when they beat a path to your office take off their pants and sit on wax paper to talk

to you when you are at risk for their Wellness you will be treating patients that currently never come to your office you'll be digging them out because you'll see on the zap zap get it Zeus aggregated profile I've been marketing very good I've been marketing anyway you'll see the zap will wake up and say this guy's your problem not the guy in your office go get him and you'll have automated Outreach and you'll have Salesforce you'll have tools that you've built and you'll bring the highest

security highest Rising risk people before you so that's what you do with it cool all right uh two different ends to that right the first one is getting the data for a bunch of places we've been talking about this forever but you have hes you have now the uh aggregators you have the qens all these sort of guys you're sitting on top of that right you're not sh scripts you have all those you're sitting on top of that mhm okay um there's some fun and games in that department at the moment between

partic Thrones exactly and there is a a person you have met and known over the years still hanging out in Wisconsin controlling controlling a lot of of that there's lawsuits of Plenty give me a flavor about how attainable everything is now um on the acquisition side yeah it's a good question like you know it I guess it didn't get killed sharing data did not get killed in utero right it really was beat up in utero I mean the the cures Act was passed in it's called the 2016 act right this2 it was an a bomber Administration

had another different it it was like cured done done yeah next project but uh and and so there was lots and lots of Ru making and avoidance and I don't know what the meaning of access and who are you and I can't tell but you know we in 2025 or 2024 exchanged more records electronically than we completed a transactions I mean that it's a big number now um and there were sitting in the headquarters of a included elf you know probably soon to go public there are th you know we watch laaga there are

thousands and thousands of companies that live on the supposition that they will have a longitudinal patient Centric picture of the people they're taking risk for yeah so I think the genie kind of somehow got out of the bottle so now they can't crush it but maybe they can you know tighten it uh I think they sort of have a point in the early days of this because they're doing all the compute on their side for free right and they're giving away data that makes it easier to not use the hospital like you what is this you're

bleeding me out but yeah I mean that EMR was paid for by not them and uh uh and that's the deal um I think probably eventually nobody in the EMR business of old will want to be the holder of the record anymore uh I think I think the database in the basement of the Epic system is a little bit like your early iTunes collection yeah like you know oh yeah of course you're going to want to Steve Jobs like yeah you got to own your you know songs but eventually these Swedish guys or whatever they will put the swedes showed up and said you can

owns that song or I can give you every song that ever was sung and the singers all the singers and all you know and you're like for 12 bucks H but I love my little songs you know uh so I imagine eventually the way that unfair cost um problem is solved is that people just sort of back away from having their own separate database and they start joining federations and hopefully Zeus will be one of those federations so let's look to the other side right the users so now the data is arriving and I'm I'm a user

you mentioned risk adjustment there's obviously a whole view of the patient for a bunch of reasons all predicated on hopefully more money showing up somehow in a payment structure to the people who are filling gaps in care to the road on colist to go the how do you how do you you know I see the numbers from humanas saying oh well we've inched up for our man for our Medicare Advantage population from you know 22% of them being in Risk capitation to 23% being in Risk capitation doesn't look like it's

moving that fast uh but there's a lot of other peripheral stuff you mentioned payments of risk and quality and whatever how fast is it moving how much squealing slash uh aggressive you think about it we were in the sort of orgiastic beach party you know in 2019 2021 right so if you're human and this beach party spaz who does a really good job with you know soft tissue oncology management and shows amazing it's like I'm not sure what I do with you like I've got millions of members you know they're

seen by thousands of practices that are you know established you I would break you if I sat on you you know yeah now 25 those companies have either grown up and are strong and can handle human or they've merged into something that's you know could handle so as they as the the the the the the manic phase sort of dies down and and we had a sort of depressed phase in 23 right where no money came out to anybody a lot of people died and now we're kind of getting into a place where some of those commercial payers uh the big guys will

say yeah you know I could do that deal I I see the ROI um and the HR departments it'll start to be normalized for for benefits I know what that is I could buy that um before it was like what there like 10 companies with Forward Thinking HR departments and three payers that do Forward Thinking stuff and there's like a line around the block like the first opening of the Apple Store you know my oncology digital my my ADD Digital My acute metal illness digital you know they're all waiting to get to those

three people who know how to buy an immature thing yeah you know now now they're either dead or not immature or emerged into something that's not immature so I think you'll be less depressing uh as an observer there'll be traction there're certainly having some some bigger numbers going with some loader people as you mentioned we're sitting in included Health's office which has a very nice view even though it's still I'm not I'm not a I'm not a uh I'm not bullish on San Francisco real

estate occupancy levels given see what happen did Salesforce send everybody back sales Salesforce they were going to be the Canan as far as I'm aware Salesforce Tower has no Salesforce employees in it but that's by the way um I I heard B Mark was threatening everybody's going to go back uh certainly Amazon threaten that we'll see how it actually works out um I led that I was in the Amazon uh elevator and they have like whiteboard elevators so you can draw and then HR lady had written on the back disagree and

commute apparently apparently uh when they planned it out they didn't have enough room for all the employees that's saw they like they better leave yeah you hopefully some of them won't won't come back for other reasons we'll find other things to do all right um so back to being being uh being happy or being depressed um bigger picture um you know the business of digital Health that you kind of started first company to go public back in 2008 seven seven long time ago right um we've had our uh we still have our

wounded wounded pigs sitting in the ditch or whatever you might want to call them what do you think happens to that group can home and buy all of them well mating is a form of survival I mean you know you're consolidating when you're weak is is a is a move right and you know Glenn has Capital so he can sort of uh if you have capital and you're ready to Double Down uh that chapter of the Eco the the cycle you know can be beneficial you can get some scale now of course every time you do one of those it looks great gives

good press release and then you got to rationalize the two things you know the net the net mandate for 25 for this stage of the cycle is gross margin scale it's got to be a percent and it's got to be a lot yeah and until you've got that you don't have the makings of a business that gets to liquidity and that shareholders will ever you know see their money from and and you know there's other St stages of the thing um some of which I kind of didn't know about till I got fired but um uh but that's the stage that most of

this this this uh cohort of kind of Technology meets care and it's one thing software eats world comes to healthcare uh crowd and uh and we're seeing those mergers and we're seeing mean included you know merged with a provider because they're like I can't get down I can't earn the right to navigate because nobody's calling the refrigerator magnet number to get navigated so I gotta actually be their doctor to to do a better job that's an example of this chapter um and you know Glenn's got the

same thing with the other with you know getting a great big Navigator but be able to touch the patient um and so I bet we see a ton more of those I've already i' I've been you know yening all week with people uh you know you guys you like you both like books you know come together um over that do you think the next do you think we see you know we have this incredibly bubbly AI S&P 500 based on six different companies all of which are buying their stuff from one company which and hopefully it all works in in

the J way way do you think we get a the next TR included obviously in that Ro is and all the other because been around for a long time do you think that happens in the next year or two next 12 to 18 months I definitely know it's going to happen I just don't know if we're going to see it or if it's under the hood and you won't notice it so this gross margin project that you know this like so at Zeus the first AI use case was we get all these there's three stations in the Zeus Factory fresh

making which is named after the good people at Mentos you know find every event as quickly as possible go there get the data pull it back y right anytime Betty gets a prescription who gave it to her where's that office is there a chart is there a note get it right second thing sense making after fresh making there's sense making open this [ __ ] up and it is [ __ ] and read it what happened in there what is in the note there's nothing in the EMR clicky click Fields okay well what did the doctor say in the dictation okay take

that put it in the clicky click fields and create a structured object can then use uh to go and deliver or shape care right right most of the data is in the note we could either have 4,000 you know folks in the great nation of India you know reading and typing or one engineer training one large language model to just find the [ __ ] and Kaboom we're up to doubling of the content off the same message set so same number of you know about 268 ccds when I pull your zap you be 668 but anyway you know a life well

lived going new knee whatnot anyway uh that work would have been years in working the economic model to justify the cost blah blah blah done one year one guy Done Right same thing with other aspects of Ze like the lenses the different summarizations of the data it's like remote control it's like pitch Zoom suddenly oh you're an oncologist you want to see you know that part of the chart first oh you're you're an ortho you want to see the Imaging and the and the uh encounter history first okay you know so fast so I

think you're going to see a lot of what I wouldn't call AI in sure let's call it ai ai Innovation which is just freaking use AI you know they tools they're available go buy them plug them in and start training them I I don't think of it as justification of uh some sort of spike in multiple but it certainly enables a lot of companies that would have been a lot wobbler for a lot longer to be stable and profitable at a price point that is attractive to people so I definitely think you're going to see it

I it's not going to be like entire new products where you never go to the doctor again or all the talk that you when you when you read uh you know when you get too much time in substack which which might not survive the AI Revolution not me all right um so and then on Tik Tok I can't get time yeah well then you won't be able to be on Tik Tok off the end of this week we'll see luckily uh in 2018 when I was unemployed on my couch I I had him a run in with the Tik Tock safety video I had swiped so many times

that the this a handsome man who looked like he was on the Old Spice hi there looks like you've been on Tik Tok for a very long time and we're worried about your safety like holy [ __ ] so I deleted it the next day and I haven't been back so I won't be s you're you're ahead of the curve again yeah I got rid I got rid of them all I'm not blaming them I blame myself Tik Tok Instagram all that [ __ ] was just too much fun it's designed that way right I think all right uh let's close with bigger

picture a we have uh an interesting group coming back into power and with some very interesting people yeah yeah good better and then you know the whole overview of yeah we're getting more and more you're getting paid for a bit of quality this and you're getting paid for that but what about in reality how much are we going to sort of get off that fever service treadmill that a big system that trend line I mean I've seen you cover it I it's moving it's Maring I mean the first wave was very performative it was the

hospital system saying no Obama I really am accountable care you know now can I go back to jacking Hospital nights you know uh I I actually think now you've got a lot of money going into that and you know the companies I get a look at the books of you know Firefly in particular like used to get a look at the books when I was on the board like wife but she won't show the book you're not going be on the board you can't look at the book um but she uh she doesn't talk that way that was me being a jerk

sorry um um they're generating like 20% reductions in tme now you know should they be charging more you I don't know but it's a it's not like bending Trend it's not this wimpy [ __ ] like it's real movement uh and I see that all these compan I got a you know oosi I'm an angel and holy cow these are huge changes and outcomes so I fully you know what's the old line you know Future's already here it's just not even distributed definitely some new future is here now will we get it distributed

depends on how well these guys get gross margin will the gross margin happen merge use AI use Zeus use infrastructure tools that are shared and get there and I think a lot will get it and it will move the needle I mean I think you know if you think about it step back the oosi the world for IBT or Firefly for primary care whatever it is yeah there's a ton of them out there we know the people in those especially those people with those ongoing chronic diseases will never sove well right and if you can find an or

find an organization like that which would do it better yeah you know you should have happier patients and yes you should be able to make money off it and by the way it should cost a lot less cuz you're getting the diagnosis right this is one of the one of the uh biggest surprises for me about digital Health was I was like oh yeah for the vegan Mountain bik biker like you sure Primary Care remote cuz basically they don't have primary care anyway they don't give a [ __ ] what blew me away and almost

killed me at Firefly was it was professional it was sick people yeah it was people who that you you that I thought might never adopt that adopted first they were like I can't keep taking days off of work for this diabetes but I need it to be managed and going once a month or two say no I really need to go back it's not working I need help you know to be able to do that at a red light you know five times a week and actually have a doctor actually say you know what you're right let's try uh upping at a

tiny bit or let's try switching to a you know injection for a while whatever that's and to have it be cheaper than going to the doctor like holy [ __ ] that's a that's a big that's an mon that's a big new thing and when you look at I mean the companies that seem to be doing well on zoo I can see obviously who's spiky up the average crowd there's 80 of them 80 companies they're averaging 20% of quarter growth now it's just 80 and there's thousands so I'm sure many are dying or

whatever but these people are doing complex [ __ ] these aren't this isn't like give me a Viagra this is like acute mental illness this is Advanced diabetes this is heart disease and and and and these digital first Solutions are affecting people who were whose care was necessarily gappy just because of employment needs and God forbid cost yeah well let's end on the optimistic note I'm Jonathan Bush CEO of Zeus and uh buy Zeus for all your data needs and buy Zeus for all your data needs all all

the other stuff is good gentlemen thanks your time take care guys
