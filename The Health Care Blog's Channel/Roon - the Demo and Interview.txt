[Music] hi Matthew hton another TCB Spotlight here I'm here with Rohan rrishna and Vian bashran V butcher your name too much there uh um they are respectively the chief medical officer and the CEO of Rune which is pretty new company um which just got funded late last year uh to essentially answer questions in healthcare and I thought this is quite quite interesting so Rohan you're a uh you're a a neurosurgeon right correct and brain tumor specialist yeah working on yes because we can't we can't be we can't be

only a specializ this neurosurgeon you have to be typic type of neurosurgeon right and VCR you're just a tech guy so you you don't have that kind of medic medical special but um I wanted to to for you guys to tell me a bit about why did you think that answering getting doctors to answer consumers and patients questions was important given Ai and Google and you know Mayo Clinic and all these other things we've got online now why did you think there was a need and room for a company like

run amazing well U thank thank you so much firstly for having us um I can maybe kick off with the the the Genesis of the idea from the S of someone navigating this as a non- doctor and then Rohan uh will will tell you a little bit about how he saw the problem from the perspective of a physician um and so so for me you know I was at Pinterest for many years and um at the time my dad was diagnosed with ALS and ALS is a rare neurod degenerative condition um my dad was in India and we spent about 18 months trying to figure

out what exactly he had and like most famili navigating something hard because of access issues to neurologists and experts um we went to the internet and I think everyone does this and we found the internet to be a very scary place you know the biggest tech companies will take you down rabbit holes of misinformation disinformation um you don't know what is true and what is not and then if you're not in a Google kind of dystopian uh misinformation Loop you're spending time on online forums and

Facebook groups on Tik Tok and Instagram uh trying to learn and trying to just understand you know what this thing is and so um I found that process very stressful underwhelming and I had kind of a heads scratching moment where I said you know if we put so much stock so much intellectual capital and and physical capital into building amazing consumer experiences for shopping for entertainment you know like the company I worked at Pinterest why is it that for most of humanity when you're navigating

something hard you know the best you have is Dr Google um and you know or you're just in this infinite waiting game for a specialist or doctor to get back to you um and so I felt we could do better and I wanted to solve the problem you know for the specific use case I had um and and you know I let Rohan then Rohan and I came together and Rohan had the same Insight but from a different uh Vantage Point yeah so uh thanks viam I think as a practicing neurosurgeon and brain tumor specialist I just had this

you know consistent set of observations where my patients were being actively harmed by the internet you know so much of the time as a patient you were spent outside of the hospital outside of the office and so what do we do now in now we're in 2025 when we're by ourselves you know faced with a new diagnosis or any new challenge in our life we're often online and those online sources for health include things like Dr Google which is 7% of Health Search WebMD Reddit groups Facebook Instagram and Tik Tok and so

many of those places are completely completely ridden with misin misinformation and disinformation and I had many patients come to me and say hey I tried dog dewormer or even a little bleach you know for my Glo blastoma and it's not that they were doing it out of ignorance they were desperate looking for answers and I think when you're in some of these social media forums there's no expert in the room right and so people out of desperation are trying these things and are prayed upon by uh

scam artists and we've talked to lots of Facebook moderators who run uh Health groups and they all say there's lots of people who literally try and pre on the people who are uh suffering with an illness to try and make a quick buck and so you know we POS the question what would it take to give everyone a free personalized guide for health powered by the knowledge of the world's best experts you know available anytime any place 24/7 and so I thought that to do this well would require not just medical

thinking but uh amazing people from consumer technology and so um to really make something that resonates with the public at large and so that's why vickram and I and our other co-founder Aron partnered together to uh make um run that's great so uh I would say that the idea of can we sort of extract the knowledge that's been implanted into doctors over the you know Generations but obious you know over over their careers and made that more easily available um to to the public it's been

tried once or twice and then you obviously have a lot of information there are all information services for doctors I mean think of up to dat and you know now now a whole bunch of AI based tools trying to trying to trying to generate that information more quickly EAS to support clinicians in what they're doing but but we haven't really got to a great place I mean you know you really have you know Mayo Clinic or whatever with their fairly generic articles about particular conditions right you don't have the sort

of the in-depth stuff and you don't have the particular um information from named particular doctor story that you guys are thinking about doing it so um I guess my question is I know there a couple C have tried this in the past going way back when organized wisdom in the sort of not even the 2010s the 2000s was trying this but I mean why do why do you think this hasn't happened happened in the past and how much of that is because doctors haven't had an easy way to do this to sort of present themselves

how much is this been a supply problem uh or maybe a institutional problem why doctors been prevented by their institutions or something that what do what do been going on stuff why you know why is it that you can find out anything you like in a in a in a Reddit forum and you have to hope the other commentators are not just making jokes but actually saying something sensible but you haven't really had you know access to the best Minds from Columbia stand Northwest whatever you know write your

list down I think it's a great question and it's really a why now question right and I think yeah I would answer it multiple ways one is that um what we do at run is make it really easy for doctors to create you know most doctors don't go into medicine to become Tik Tock influencers or Instagram influencers right we go into medicine to take care of patients and public and health education is part of the job and I think that the things if the the one aspect of medicine that every doctor despite all its challenges

will say they still enjoy is that patient doctor interaction right that's still fun that part is still what makes people come back to work despite all the rubbish we have to do on a regular basis compliance work all these infinite trainings that are to check a box but you don't really learn anything you know that part of medicine people could do without but the fa patient physician interaction is still what's special and that's what we tap into when we create content on Rune and so we make it super

easy for doctors you know to create one viral Instagram or Tik Tok video might take you hours right and but in a you spend an hour with us we'll give you 20 to 30 great pieces of content that you can use not just not just to educate your own patients but to educate the global audience you know and run is over in over a 100 countries now today I think the second aspect of the why now is that the problem of misinformation disinformation and Trust has gotten exponentially worse in the last 10 or 15

years was something that happened five years ago they may have played into that I can't think what it was I have no I have no comment there either but but you know we look at the measles uh what's going on with measles today right like measles why are we talking about measles in 2025 this should not be a problem and yet just because we have sadly someone at the very top of our political food chain talking about not getting vaccinated or taking cod liver oil Etc we have measles outbreaks right there's

someone on the train here in New York who had measles and so there's I think an understanding that you can't be passive if you want to educate the public at large uh when it comes to health information vivc morthy our Surgeon General has talked about how our former Surgeon General has talked about how Public Health misinformation is is one of the big public health problems and so I think doctors have woken up to the fact that we have to be active you know you can't fight misinformation with you know um you

know with a flood of misinformation with raindrops you know you need to fight fire with fire and so that's what we helped them do and just the one thing to add that the other fascinating thing that's happened is you know every platform kind of birds of a base of creators that didn't exist before you know whether Tik Tok dancers whether for Pinter it was early lifestyle bloggers I think in medicine there's a whole generation of doctors who have grown up actually with Instagram with Tik Tok

seeing these platforms as consumer platforms um seeing the pandemic and seeing kind of some of their peers step up and actually teach and educate at scale and I think this is definitely a post-pandemic company where it used to be like oh a doctor won't get on a camera and won't create content um and because it feels completely antithetical to like inpatient care but so many amazing Physicians started doing it at scale whether it's Bob wer you know at UCSF uh Vin Gupta all the way up to the US

Surgeon General that you started seeing these models of just both great doctors and everyday doctors do this very easily and so it's been amazing to just see the the interest from just young Physicians who feel that actually public education is part of their kind of moral obligation um and we want to kind of capture that energy and be a place that celebrates and honors them I mean that's great and I actually you know I always felt that as one of the very early Health Care bloggers but I'm a politics

business Tech Guy not a not a medical clinical person that this you know the blog and social media gave the opportunity for so many doctors to do one the many broadcasting as opposed to the one the one they do every day in their offices with their patients and it it it it never really took off um on those medium I don't know whether it's because you know it was too hard too complex I don't know I got the impression there was concerns about you know there were concerns about sort of stay going outside your lane and

possibly upsetting the you know your your employer your host institution obviously most doctors now have an employer so you know and there is there's a whole bunch of stuff there which I I'd love to get into a bit as we get into this is to you know how did you encourage the first I don't know how many doctors you have on the platform now but you obviously read early on you have many more but how did you encourage that first group to get on and how do you sort of protect them from these uh

from all those reasons why they Perhaps Perhaps may have felt nervous about going onto a to a platform like this before yeah start I think um again just relative to where as vickram said as a post-pandemic company so many doctors were suddenly on Twitter right before it was x uh Bob wter who's one of our great docs on Rune chair of medicine at UCSF had an amazing Twitter presence where he was talking I'm sure you saw daily weekly about his assessment of you know I'm still not over with the fact that he only had like

a half half a paragraph about me in his book and he went down the streets of the rock elf people had like three pages and you know they had a photo and stuff and we we we're still having more words about that every time we see each other but all right good good you're right he I mean he did an amazing job you know as had Eric toel and many others you know exactly but I would say that those are kind of like the Superstar well-known doctors in area who you know and and who have kind of a public presence what you

know I think what you're doing a lot more and that's you you could I don't want to interrupt you to say that there's also there's the sort of layer down of people who have incredible skills and incredible knowledge and of you know working like you are around at the height of your profession but that knowledge is doesn't you know there's not an easy way for that knowledge to to come out to Everyday patients yeah exactly and I think um so many of the early and early people that came to Rune

it was very multidisiplinary effort we started our first condition was GBM so it was neurosurgeons neuro oncologists social workers PT speech finance and legal you know really anyone that had expertise to share and so what we found is that people love getting together and sharing information and connecting and educating its scale like we all these people were from around the country and we used to have like these GBM Thursdays where people would come at 5 o'clock and if you've ever tried to her doctors into

a meeting even at the same institution getting calendars together is incredibly hard but you know people will make time for things that they're interested in and so we saw from there and even until now that people are really love being part of technology and like you know providing value in a way that's like very easy you know to so many people including their own patients you know you know we find that people have automatically started using Rune in their own offices you know they'll put

Rune in the ABS you know and we see that at M multiple institutions now you know big academic medical institutions where both before the visit after the visit they're saying hey you can supplement your learning with on run and you'll see you'll find find me there right because it's great to see great doctors on run RIT large but it's also great to see your own doctor and I think that engagement and um education people are getting you know our doctors are saying the visits are just better quality time

with the patients right it's less time spent on kind of re-educating or on basic things they can get really into the into the meat of the matter so I think convincing people in the post-pandemic stage or era was actually not it wasn't that hard you know people wanted this to exist and so um thankfully you know hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of doctors later um you know there's a lot of social proof that this is the platform to do it on so the goal is I'm a consumer I come to Rune I may have been told to go on by

my own doctor I may have been you know just just go there from whatever reason I assume your SEO work is is from Rec from your perspective is continuing a pace but I mean so so why don't you show me I'm going to the the application and show me what the uh the experience is like you haven't seen seen it um and give us an idea of the range of the sort of questions and the the subjects that you're currently working on kind of the Corpus of knowledge that you built so far and how you bringing

that out um so so what I'm showing you here so run there's a mobile app and there's a web optimized uh there's a desktop optimized website and so I'm showing you the app on on on web and on desktop this is run.com um and we have we work on you know we started an ALS and and GBM but we work on a whole range of different Health areas uh what I'm showing you right now is actually uh the app for people navigating fertility uh or um and and family building and so everything we

do uh centers on on the expert and so if you come to the service one of the first places you will be taken to is uh the range of different experts who who create content and in this case answer short form video Q&A um you can see an expert this is Dr Amanda adelay um you can see all her answers to are most common questions whether it's you know what's the best piece of advice for someone starting their fertility Journey how do I choose a fertility clinic um and it's all short videos with

how do I choose a fertility clinic I think there are a number of things to think about number one the most important is going to be how do you feel when you're in that clinic not just with your potential doctor but also with this yeah so this is an example of Amanda answering answering this question it's a very complex question loaded with lots of this is a big decision um looking into the camera like you're almost like FaceTiming her um and you get the answer to that question but you also see other

questions that are similar um like Amanda there's a range of different providers in the of fertility and family building you know the the Specialties that matter are reproductive Endocrinology high-risk or B we have embryologist genetic counselors and all of these experts are uh from the leading academic hospitals as well as fertility clinics they all have been vetted by us they're all both we look for people that are the kind of overlapping vend diagram of very credentials and and great

communicators um when people do this and we get a bunch of experts who create content and um they they give us all of these answers we then organize these answers into topics and so if you're a user you can come here and browse a range of different topics these topics map back to kind of the patient Journey the most common places that you might look most people don't know what they don't know when they navigate a new uh Health area and so we spend a lot of time thinking about the map so to speak

of you know if you're in IVF for instance you know this is broken down by step because f is very linear what are all the different steps and under each of these we have collections of questions uh from this different multidisiplinary I see so that would then get you back to the expert so you can get to the you can get to the sort of the exploration of the map and people love this idea of like multiple perspectives and so so some question you know whenever we ask a question you'll get lived experience experts and then

you might also get you know someone who's a who's a medical expert and so we combine the lived experience with the medical because health tend to be practical social you know emotional um and so people love this idea of just being able to learn in a very human way by seeing expert driven answers it's short it's digestible you don't have to read you know a long article or listen to a webinar um and then if you have a question you know many people don't know what they don't know and they are in the

kind of browsing learning I'm looking at both either people who are experts or topics but if you have a question um that is um top of mine you can come here and ask it I'm using a predefined question here run is giving you an instant answer it's pulling from um our Corpus of information so this is an AI feature that summarizes basically what we have on our carpus so it doesn't pull from like the the the web at large and so people love this idea of it's a finite amount of knowledge it's all expert driven and I

can both read and actually look at the sources of the information so in this case this is Dr Randy Goldman who's another reproductive endocrinologist um and um well that's Randy there this is Dana McQueen and um I can also see questions that are related to this question so if I ask that question you know what are the mo what question should I ask my fertility doctor about egg freezing is a logical next question so so in in in the case here you're taking this is I this is AI going and and and essentially

summarizing from the transcript of the answers that these doctors or experts have given is that correct ex yeah so you of Health Journeys most people are like hey I just landed in this new city it's a City without a map teach me what I should know so you can browse who are the experts I want to know them from people and you know very often people like certain people uh they're like hey I actually want this information but I want it from Dr Randy Gman she communicates in a way that is like you

know perfect with what how I think about bedside manner you know and then if I have a burning question you know many of these health conditions we work on there's a lot of there's a lot happening outside of a clinic and your next appointment with an REI might be in four months you know there's only like 1,800 Reis in the country and one in six you know couples navigate infertility you can come here and ask a question and get an instant answer um we I want to show you also the dementia uh app just just

go back to a second how many room how many uh areas you built out so far these are the ones you built out so far click on that link again today Rune focuses on you know ALS and GBM as well we started uh dementia uh which was our next condition and then we're in the process of launching uh rune for a range of different women's health conditions and Women's Health areas and so PCOS endometriosis uh paropa and menopause and then U fertility and family building and so I assume there's a ton more here

that you're going to on the road map notice diabetes Cardiology whatever but you know exact exactly yeah the goal is to do 200 plus over the next 18 months uh go ahead Rohan I think one thing to add on the instant answer uh question is that it is really fascinating when you look at our data about what questions people are actually asking us um people once they start using Rune um are literally telling us their life story and want help and talking to us like we're their doctor right and I think getting immense

value even though we're not providing direct medical advice getting immense value from the service in in from the types of questions that we're offering because we're not just talking about anodin superficial answers to questions um we get very deep into every condition we can go both Broad and very deep into every condition we touch and because we're getting multiple perspectives on and question for which there should be multiple perspectives you know we get that Nuance right the Nuance in medicine

because most medicine's not governed by phase three clinical trials it's Mo mostly in the gr so you can see how leading experts May differ slightly on important questions when it comes to the management of disease and so I think um that's been a real fascinating thing to do and we actually one of our things we'd love to do this year is publish you know um like thematic report about like one of the first projects I want to do is you know in the fertility space is there a difference in terms of what the

informational needs are in blue States versus red States nowadays given the the legal issues that are out there um and so those are lots of different interesting academic projects we can do but it just shows you how the informational journey and the agency that people are looking for can be solved by expert guidance so going back just for a second to the if you want to show it again V the uh the the can you can you pull up uh uh back to the thing pull up a pull up an expert um I want to ask sort of how did how did this uh so

if I'm an OBG how do I kind of qualify to get on the site and then clearly you're depending on my expertise you know yes I went if I if I'm at UCSF and I've done my residen medical school there I'm probably pretty smart and I probably I'm probably very you know mainstream and understand a bunch of stuff around this and probably have my expertise and you know you have Dr Rowan's bio up here but at some point are you you know that these are her answers that she's given

to these questions are you are you going go back to this conversation about misinformation um what are and you're grabbing from these answers for your for your other for your uh I think you call it the explore you know the answers to this text what level of editorial are you doing or are you just trusting to the process so how does she get there or how does a doctor get on this system and once they're on there how are you making sure the quality of information is you know as high as it ought to be if you

got UCSF doctors giving the answer yeah so we actually we we Source doctors in multiple ways we actually are a very heavy medical team you know we have a chief platform officer medical platform officer named Dr Joshua Lang he's a cardiologist that trained at the bringham we have um uh you know other doctors that trained at Oxford for example someone uh we have Pas on the team um and so we have lots of medical deep inhouse medical Talent uh which is really great and so we basically whenever we launch a condition really

try and find who are the experts in the field experts at academic medical institutions people who see a large volume of patients in the condition we're going after people who have published in that topic and then um who do the those experts recommend once we talk to them right um in terms of other people who can also contribute their expertise and so we really evaluate and talk to everyone that's on the service before they're on the service in the first place um so that's the first thing

we do a lot of vetting um when they contribute answers to Rune we actually quality check at every single aspect of the process so some of it is technical like is the audio and video good other aspects of it are how Evergreen is this content on one spectrum is why the sky blue you never really have to update that right um on the other hand what's the implications of this phase one clinical trial well we know the phase two and the phase three will eventually come out we have to update that later

and so um we have a rubric internally about how to like go about updating things um and um over time that'll have more you know as you can imagine more technological sophistication using Ai and other things uh but yeah we we're quality and trust or trust is the epicenter and the foundation of everything we do and so quality is obviously really important part of that is that going to be manageable when you get to 200 I how many doctors per per specialty but when you get to more and more doctors and more and more sub

special is I mean there's obviously as it is we're amount we have like I said hundreds and hundreds of doctors already we have more than 20,000 videos as it is so we we have a good system that works in terms of quality control and then the other thing is so right I'm the world's leading expert on ABC what what's in it for me to come under own am I getting paid am I getting uh just doing this for the for the the good of humanity am I you know there's obviously a lot of people contributing you know if you

become a Tik Tok star you can make some money midle you're probably doing dancing or whatever but you know not doing medical knowledge but what what's the uh what's the incentive for those doctors to come on to run yeah I can start um so I think the incentive structure is multiple I think the first thing is most doctors don't need influencer dollars you know to do this that's not going tell me we're paying our neuros sessions enough as it is we don't so yeah so I think that is not the

motivating factor I think when we first started you know we did because we value doctor's time you know doctors you have to understand doctors are constantly as asked to do things for free right um on for their hospital system for whoever um and we recognize that doctors are you know they time famished Etc and so we want to respect their time so you know at the beginning days we certainly offered an honorarium it's not nearly as much as they might get paid in the open market from a pharmaceutical company but

enough to say that hey um um you know you're we respect you you know and and that kind of thing and so that's not the the draw though the draw is that I'm I'm creating this profile that I can educate my own patients with at scale that I can keep using again and again you know we're not entertainment so it's not a question of volume of content right where you're trying to populate a feed like once you create like I created a surgery guide for my patients with gleo blasto I don't have

to keep updating that it's like really good as it is and so yeah when I have like a new idea or whatever I can add to it but you know my basics of what to think about and do the day before surgery unlikely to changed for years you know um unless something new happen so I think the ability to educate your own patients and like make it easier in your own medical workflow has been a real draw I think being part of this community of science communicators has been fun I think people like this idea

of of collaborating with all these other doctors from all around the country that you might not ever ever meet um being part of digital Health company and a startup has been another reason so it's many many things I wouldn't say it's one um but I think this idea of creating this new place where doctors share knowledge that doesn't exist today if you think about it where's the place that doctors share knowledge with either each other or patients um at scale and so I think there there's a lot of

excitement around that vicam would you add anything yeah I think the for me the most um you know I again not coming from the medical world I used to always watch Khan Academy talks right Aman Khan the famous teacher and you know if you think of the archetype of someone who like loves teaching and I had that kind of like data point in my head and then I always had specific doctor friends in my life who were just amazing at Rohan being one of them right like amazing teachers like you ask a hard question

Rohan might start with like hey here's how the brain works and I knew these people existed which is like there just exceptional teachers uh and what's very heartening for me to see is most of the people who come to the service their eyes light up because they like self-identify as one of those people but in everyday kind of clinical work you know the teaching part gets kind of underinvested right you're just you have 15 minutes to see someone and you're like just so focused on the

next patient in fact some of the ALS doctors tell us they have like 12 minutes to communicate a death sentence as a diagnosis and then where does all that stuff around teaching go and so I think we've tapped into like a certain archetype of the doctor teacher the doctor explainer um it's not all doctors but I think that's what makes it makes it special it's like a kind of a lead community of someone that like when they see us and we see them they're like oh I I do this every day I'm drawing I'm drawing the

left ventricle when my patient comes in you know and ask me about the heart um and that's what been and we're building around this like very special community so the the obvious answer is as you grow in general Specialties doctors the rest of it um is this going to become a thing where you hope every doctor eventually will be on the platform because I as a doctor even if I'm not a harbit or Columbia or whatever doctor but you know I'm out there in the community but I want to use this to communicate with my

patients or you going to limit it to quote unquote lead expert this is a really good question I think there's you know like all good Creator Network work like 10% of the people create 90% of the value in the content and so we've been we have a whole road map around what are all the other ways in which you can engage a doctor and make it useful for them without them having to create and so the goal is to get every provider on the service but then not not everyone necessarily has to be a Creator um and

you know we're mapping out kind of all the different ways in which you can share curate and be part of an ecosystem so so I think that that that kind of leads to the to a fork right one fork is while this is going on while if you could take every all the knowledge from all the best doctors you know all the leading medical establishments in the country the Mayors the Stampers or whatever um and publish it you know in the way you're doing that that that's great you got you got two things going on one is

that um you've got a bunch I mentioned earlier you got a bunch of public a bunch of organizations U four public organizations who are currently either using medical information transmitting to doctors or using medical information and transmitting of our or AI tools which are going in and looking at you know medical information and that's become very accessible to patients as well as you know so I'm kind of interested in how you how you're thinking about the sort of the the the difference between patients going

looking for AI based stuff which you know there are a lot of aggressive patients talking about already there are a lot of very uh aggress aggressive Forward Thinking patients in those you know patient chat rooms and have you've been talking about even if they have run the risk of being bambooz with medical medical misinformation or the rest of it so how do you think about that and on the other hand you've got um the world where yes it's great that somebody from Columbia or or or or UCF or whatever can

can do this but increasingly those organizations are being much more sort of aware of their own brand and their relationship with their doctors so I don't know if Mayo has decided that you know Mayo doctors can only participate in the Mayo Forum versus you know coming on to roof so how do you think about these two sort of dichotomy things going on where you've got sort of the corporatization of medicine on the one hand and then sort of the easy access of data and very smart intelligent agents on the other

yeah I can take that agent question you know and Ron I don't know if you want to answer the other one but you know on the agent side it's so so just two thoughts so one is obviously like chat GPD is exceptional right uh and there's just like it used to be that oh like Chachi hallucinates and like there's kind of of this you know this this idea that like Chachi PD gets like lots of fundamental stuff wrong but I think it would be foolish to pretend that it's not getting better and it's it's quite excellent um

and I think the that said there's a kind of specific type of way in which content is delivered which is it's text based it's um it's very kind of like discreet and we believe that you know when you're in a really hard place there's nothing that can replace you know a doctor answering some of the most complex questions you know uh my mom recently had a stroke very crazy subarachnoid brain hemorrhage I was on chat CPD all day right but I understanding like the basics but when it comes when it came to

like how do we think about care what are the hard questions how do you navigate the condition you know there was Andy at UCSF and like I didn't want anyone else because his bedside man or his the Nuance in which he was communicating um the kind of meta question about like how you think about navigating this you know in in a in a deeper human way is something that I just didn't get from Chachi and so I think that you know I think there's going to be infinite AI generated like text on text but

there'll be a flight to Quality and I think people will always Crave You know the the human face that can like actually navigate health is so human um and but on things that are like what are the most common symptoms things are very deterministic I think AI will do a far better job than any any doctor and I think on things that are complex and nuanced um you know we're betting that like the best medical experts collectively you know will rise to the occasion so I think the additional thing

is and I'm sure you've seen this that so much of you know 30 40 50% of medical decision-making are based on factors that are not captured in a EHR they're cultural they're contextual they're social determinance develop etc etc that like May influence how a doctor might you know counsel or guide a patient right and I think I'm not worried in the shorter even medium term that AI is going to capture all that because they doesn't have the data to do that right even in our EHR we don't type everything that

we're thinking right sort of like type the minimum to generate the bill that you need right um that is like the main thing that epic does it's a billing machine more than a documentation machine and I think the um ability to capture Nuance as viam said the ability to am use AI to amplify human expertise is something that we're betting will be the differentiating thing because in a world of infinite information and infinite text does that really comfort you I think most people don't find comfort in it I think what

people do find comfort in is like that human that expert that doctor looking at you and saying that this is how I think about this problem and I think you know based on our user feedback Etc I think we're on on the right track but you know you have to take our word for it okay and then tell me about sort of the Rune versus the big brand names in healthcare piece that you you currently have obviously a number of doctors from those Brands and I'm just wondering is there they thinking that you know this this is

this that a doctor should be talking to a Mayo Clinic on audience on a Mayo Clinic Channel or or are they you know do you think there's an issue there or am I making that one up yeah I think the actually on you take this and I'll I'll build on it yeah I think there's um most health institutions understand they need a broad multi- channel strategy to reach patients and you know keyword buys on Google are much less effective than they were even five years ago right and so what is the best way of demonstrating

your key asset as a Health institution it's your doctors right it's not the MRI machine no one cares it's like the quality of your doctors and the beauty is when you see a doctor on rune for example explaining their domain expertise there is no better brand campaign or marketing asset than that right because it's actually quite a good proxy for expertise if you can't explain or I should say if you are an amazing Communicator about your craft both at the general and the specific the broad

and the Deep it's very likely at least in my experience that you're quite a good doctor also um and you know Craftsman or craftswomen in your in your field so I think the um people see Rune all different health systems that we've talked to is an amazing way of getting their doctors out there so they view is they view as the moment is good good free publicity and it's not as basic free brand because the profiles get SEO optimized when one is that I'm searching I'm information

seeking uh you know a World expert from a clinic is showing up and so actually Hospital Systems want would rather have their doctors be in places where they're not showing up you know then in kind of a echo chamber so no I think it's very interesting right the whole the whole concept of how people are Distributing you know a port life Medical Care um especially now some that can't be delivered a distance which gets me to the sort of the the the the nitty-gritty okay so you guys raised 15 million a

series a I think you recently you raised a bit of money before that as well is that right yeah we did a seed round before that so you know you raised a bit of money this involves ugly Venture capitalists coming into the room and one day they're going to ask you you know how you're going to make some money and and give it back so um I could see a number of possibilities including you know obviously connecting directly to the doctors and and getting involved in that sort of flow and and delivering

poti delivering care that way obviously there's advertising there's there's uh there's but you got to basically direct to consumer product rather than direct to addition product which so changes the world of that so what's the basic uh and obviously put in the thing that fa silic Valley forever has had this idea well we can get a lot of people on our system then we'll figure out how to make money the sort of Cheryl seberg concept of you know we'll ride the face with rocket ship and then figure out how

to make money out it later and they did so but what's your sense of what the monetization and what the sort of financial strategy for run is going to be yeah I think I'll start by just saying we have we have sort of like one guiding principle around our business model which is you know initially when we started it was very tempting to say like like a lot of Health companies try to charge people directly while because selling to payers selling to companies there's just so much complexity and getting someone else

and so there's a kind of charge people directly model I think because we are in the information business and information should be free and accessible almost by definition we started with like putting free SL Premium as like the notar which is like how do we get this as accessible to as many people and then work backwards um you know and then the business model that we been kind of excited to pursue and um where we've seen a lot of interest is just in terms of sponsorships and um both from you know

Hospital Systems as well as uh life science companies and so the path that we are exploring is you know a premium business model with um most of the app free and then some parts are of like subsidized through sponsorships um and we also have seen kind of just so much of user feedback and I guess so there's so many user requests for very specific features that people want as they navigate a health journey and so like du lingo or like a lot of other services where most of the app is free uh but there are value added

Services if we have a charge it never be for information but it will be for you know something that you that users have a lot of value around you know a classic example could be you know digital note taking if you're using the Rune app in a clinic setting and you want to save your notes and actually see common questions related to your last patient visit I'm just making that as a theoretical example but that's an example of you know a value added service um and so that's been our you know that's what

we've communicated both internally as well as to investors you know and the business models as you know Pharma advertising is very large um lots of pharmaceutical companies are looking for just like other ways to um to to to connect with consumers um and then you know companies like doximity um have just built very you know robust businesses on the doctor side uh but again I think like the first principles approach here which is you know trust is at the center of the brand access is at the center of the brand and

so we would never do anything that compromises kind of trust and access um and it's hard to get it right I think as you know in healthcare um it's it's it's it's very hard to get all of the the Stars to line but you know we're pretty idealistic and I think because there's so much of value on the user side um you know we feel we'll be able to pull it off so yeah I would say that you know the obvious thing is is well r said early right you've got an editorial team there and

essentially this is the completely traditional uh you know old style New York Times newsp model you know we have we have uh content and generated you know generated content from experts and you know that's got to be good and then you have advertising SL sponsorship which stays off to the side that pays the bills and you know it seems to me that so you know where people got to the trouble is where those two lines AC crossed right and I think you've seeing a lot of if you want to go back to you

know to pick on somebody WebMD seems to be the point that you can't you can't tell where one starts and where one stops and that's I think lost a lot of the trust and I think you really have to be very careful about that having said that I suspect that if you did cross that line you would start losing your content your main content producers anyway pretty quickly so you know that would be a it's probably a self it's probably a self Tail Spin if you go down that path and get it wrong but there are

probably examples of how you can get it right and I think people are accepting the I'll put up with sing them we're like probably the most intentional thoughtful group in healthcare because we come from outside of so we're just starting with like trust and access is the key how do we kind of keep that above everything else you know so that's great so let's talk about the future you've got I think uh you said several hundred docs on the platform and uh um and others I mean you have Patient

Advocates and people have been the experience and stuff well OB you're going to grow that in the and presumably there are plenty more subdivisions of the of the four or five the eight or nine categories you currently have if I come back in uh you know a year and a half's time we do this again how many categories do you think you'll have what's the sense of you know how many commissions have on the platform what does good look like in terms of sort of growing it out and in terms of

user numbers on the medical side um vicam could speak to the user side but um on the medical side we hope to have between 150 200 new conditions in the next roughly 18 months um and that's quite L work right you go said n nine or 10 now you said so a couple hundred not I think you'll see um you know in the next two months actually a huge uptick in the number uh that we're about we launch in little batches and that batch strategy works really well um it turns out for example I can talk about lots of other things

besides brain tumors as a trained neurosurgeon right and so lots of doctors have the ability to talk about many diseases right that's part of medicine and so that ability to quickly um expand your portfolio so to speak on Rune is is naturally inbuilt into the system and so um yeah and we're pretty bullish on our ability to kind of do that and you know we have you know hundreds of meetings a month with doctors nowadays um you know inviting them and and and pitching them and getting them on to Rune and um you know

almost invariably they say yes you know and so that's been a really um great in terms of doctor Market fit I mean I I can't imagine that you know I if if that was ever a phrase then I think we definitely have it um and so that's been really exciting to see vi vi on the user side how you know how how you going to get the users and uh you know what in a world in which there's incredible you know incredible money spent PA just because each of like even just working on dementia there's

millions of people who navigate dementia this is a free app that literally guides you on some of the hardest questions and so when people find us there's this kind of moment of like why didn't I find this sooner and so and there's just so much stickiness with the product that um you know based on where we're growing I mean our goals to have millions of people using the service the next time you see us and um I think what's exciting is with each with each launch it opens up the the the opportunity to attract

more people and so uh with all the Investments we're making in the product the scale at which we're launching I think you know the goal is to have millions of users use the product and not just for very hard Health journey is like where we started but um we imagine kind of even a lifestyle kind of life cycle um consumer that comes in maybe for you know for fertility but then is like we're launching pregnancy in a few months you know Pediatrics and so I think we'll have lots of users who see

run as their guide for out Beyond just something that's more episodic and then final question uh on on that is is there a bigger play here right so if you've got a million you know hundreds of doctors in precond conditions doing that there's a lot of other other needs that those doctors can take care off for the patients yes they all currently have affiliations with with this than the other but I mean there are obviously a lot of other people delivering services online uh do you think that there is a place where

Rune becomes more than just a content company um and starts to all the services or do you saying that's all taken care of but you're better off staying away from that and just sad of being this dominant content play yeah I think the the way we think of it's it's interesting you said that because almost everyone who uses the app the number one request is like I want run to assist me more and I'm already here please assist you know um and I'm paraphrasing all our like hundreds of user researchers and so

people actually think about it as an assistant tool not just a information tool and we have a robust kind of road map around assistance um and assistance can mean anything from Guiding you to like deeper integration with your Healthcare Services um and so we definitely see ourselves you know Way Beyond kind of the information journey and it's just it's where we started because I think you have to earn the right and the trust uh around being the best place online you know like the digital front

door for health is many people have tried to like build that but we're actually trying to do it soan yeah and and and it come and it's a tricky one right again because there's so much that you could get wrong in doing this and there's so much opportunity just doing the content side um but yeah I mean you know every time I've about a health Journey it's great to learn something but it wouldn't be nice to like to go to somebody who looks like they know what they're talking about and trust me and I

can get access to could actually like help me with whatever the next thing I actually need to do usually involves seeing somebody being prodded getting a pill something you know right so it's it's a TR there's so much friction in healthcare you know Healthcare is not easy at all right and you know even most of my friends maybe the reason they keep me around as a friend is I'm a doctor and I can help guide them into the of course you thought that you good looks come on and so the the dizzying Maze of

healthcare that seems to be my biggest value at as their friend and so what if you don't have a doctor friend right like it's a it's misery I would say you know for so many people and I think given that level of friction in healthcare and you think of the you know eventual hopeful and we'll get there scale of Rune how can we use that scale of Rune um to help reduce you know to make you know you don't want to use the word delightful in healthcare but like how can you make the experience of

healthcare you know that much easier so that you're actually focusing on your health and less so on the nonsense that you have that surrounds Healthcare um and so just you know that's very Broad and vague and whatever but I think that is I think one of the powerful opportunities we'll have if we get this um you know our education and our guidance and our information right I think we'll have that opportunity at scale yeah I think it's a great place to end and that's that's you know that's

something that I talk about this and I've written about this Ador about the pain and suffering involved in when you have pain and suffering of getting to the right place and figuring out the right people and getting access to them and figuring out what it is and what it shouldn't be and how Bloody awful most medical research is and Etc so once once you get past all that you can see that you know you have this massive once you get the the whole content thing up and running you have this massive

opportunity of course you've got to be super careful because there are lot it's it's a very big and thorny Beast this this whole Healthcare System that you're working on that's that's my commentary but I I wish you both lots of luck as you're doing this all right I've been speaking with Rohan ra R Krishna he is the chief medical officer vran basaran he is the CEO of Rune Jes thanks for your time thanks for showing me what room was like and I'll come back and visit with you soon thank you so much

for having us thank you for having us
