[Music] Matthew h uh with T tanon he is the CEO of cure all right so uh T cure you're you're the boss you came from another company AIS or aist depending on how you want to call it but um T has now back by General Catalyst H Nature has put together a whole bunch of different products right so on what's now one back end that's right designed to help primarily provid us impatient and some outpatient understand give me a flavor of what are the different products set that commu is doing so I think comm's

goal first and foremost is to build software and technology that makes the lives of providers easier and we do that across the stack we start in the front office with scheduling intake patient engagement modules we have an ambient module that's probably one of the fastest scoring in the country it is on track to do 10 million appointments this year completely automatically atics and some other work you had innal that's exactly that was the camir ambient and then the atics products and then we rep

platformed them onto the cir backend and now we're scaling um and then we have revenue cycle based tool so uh agents and language models that essentially take every task that you might do in the back office for RCM and help automate or augment with a co-pilot for a human and the goal there is how do we increase collections for Health Systems when they need it the most and when they're the most behind on dollars um and then all the on the back end we have AR uh you know back office tooling parts of the

accounting stack um and and and the thesis is can we build the system of Engagement that's almost a new center of gravity next to the EMR focused on provider work Workforce and workflow automation all right what do you think is the bit that is missing the most obviously you have folks from HCA here in your boo you a bunch of other people you talking with what is the bit that is missing the most in American hospitals that needs to get fixed people have been doing you know RCM for years and trying

to get 3% more on the rest of it people have been trying to work on this hand describing it's growing fast where do you think the biggest sort of bang for the buck for someone like a cim is I think what we there was this major technology transition with what happened to Transformers and language models in the last 2 or 3 years and on the backs of that there are a whole set of capabilities that used to be things that needed a human to supervise or nurse the model along the way that now the model

can essentially do very accurately on its own and particularly task sequencing so before if you tried to have a language model do a bunch of tasks in the browser or resubmit a denial or you know come up with a prior author and appeal it would probably fail not on every task but some subtask and as a result the entire thing would go to crap with where language models are now we believe that co-pilots and autopilots aren't a dream in the future they're reality today and you know we have the numbers to show it in

terms of the ambient appointment volume you know the billions that we process autonomously on Revenue a new cycle so first and foremost there was a technology breakthrough number two I think the pains and needs of health systems are trer today than they were at any other point of time in in the last 20 30 years with potential cuts to Medicaid Medicare uh with the fact that the labor market is in a place where you you know those $60 $70,000 year billers that you can hire in groves before you just can't anymore and offshore markets

are either insecure or also becoming expensive and so you need to have a technology driven solution and so the time and the is there and the technology exists too all right you didn't mention sort of Provider experience sort of from the from the doctor and nurse perspective I know you mentioned you guys have got the uh the the strongline uh nurse safety Plus+ app you've obviously got you mentioned ambient AI a bunches which you know which people are selling I mean predominantly on improving provider experience um how

much more can we optimize you know the provider experience and efficiency how much how much is can me look on that the the way I think about it you know our job's not done until a physician can walk into a room have an encounter with a patient voice off some commands to their AI assistant around labs and ordering and then never click a button never type a single word and and leave the room and have done a very productive billable encounter uh the day we start doing that that's when you know everyone

that's here at HS and all these models are actually going to be you know having met their final purpose in terms of making a provider just focus on care that being said we have some practices now you many in our ambulatory business where uh they will use our ambient tool our autonomous revenue cycle our prior Au denials FS Automation and quite literally never maybe once or twice touch their keyboard and I think we can make that a reality for every physician at HCA and every physician in the

country so two final groupings of questions or exactly question first one is that everything you're talking about has been around and about the hospital yeah but there is this thing called the EMR which is the record you know the record the ordering system or the rest of it obviously you have just a few big players left there now MedEx one obviously in HCA but obviously epic's the big giant at what point does either stuff come out of those that threatens what you're doing or do you start

impinging on where they're what they're doing that's a great question yeah I I think the the way that I see it is the EMR at its core and we have a very you know amazing partnership with metatech uh we're partners with epic uh you know deploy ambient and other co-pilots and epic metatech Cerner sites across the country in the ambulatory with Athena ucw so we work with them all um I think it's going to be a blend of both there going to be some features that the EMR is going to build themselves and they

should build themselves uh I I I think that parts of the ambient stack like vanilla dictation and transcription are things that should be more and more native within the M whether that's done through a partner or homegrown by the Mr itself number two I think we're we there are certain tasks particularly you know around automating big parts of the providers work tax or the pains in their day that maybe the EMR isn't the right center of gravity for it because it's you know whatever you do there's always

going to be clicks there's always going to be button pressing to navigate it and it's just how it's built it's it's really a system of record meant for compliance and that's where I think there's a massive opportunity for companies like ourselves and some of the other upstarts to come in and really augment that experience you know you the way I think about it is you have Salesforce which is the Behemoth of a business in in you know Automation and operations within companies um but then

you also have companies built on top like gong and Outreach and you know a whole like uh uh there are entire software companies that are built with Salesforce their back in and they don't compete with each other but they do they do supplement each other quite well all right the second group the question second uh regat question is that you have built essentially a uh and I'm still building I assume I I I would guess there's more to come you know all that big grouping lots of different applications to have

on one common back end there's a ton if you go around the hall here look at AI even look at within General Catalyst portfolio there's a ton of other companies who look like they do some parts of that yeah right what do you think the uh the sense you're getting between buying one company to do them all versus you know best of breed in the AI world is at the moment well I I think the the beautiful thing is that when the healthcare Market is so massive that like quite genuinely you will have companies that overlap in

features with each other and overlap in Specialties with each other and still are independently going to be 10 20 50 hundred billion businesses and so our belief is that you know because one of how inquisitive Cur has been around rep platforming and and bringing a setup capabilities we think there's A1 billion software company to build here and that's what we're trying to do um really built and centered around the provider's experience and the back office experience now does that mean that there

aren't sub verticals and sub Specialties of many other massive businesses no not necessarily and and and I think we'll compete with them in some cases we'll partner with them in other cases but at the end of the day it's just as long as the end goal is solved you know what hont always says is to solve this $4 trillion Market you need an ecosystem of companies not one Behemoth that's that's you know the elephant in the room you really do need an ecosystem all right well let's close with himon he bought a

health system and then there's all kinds of weird announcements from General Catalyst about it becoming a fund and going public and God as well talk to me about what your role is within the sort of ecosystem of General Catalyst companies and what's going on in Ohio and are you going to be involved yeah first I you know working with hont and general catalyst is is I mean such an honor and such a pleasure because s truly an ambitious firm and an ambitious man um and you know I I think the uh

we've learned so much camir was incubated as part of General Catalyst and so many of our core strategies they're literally like these are General Catalyst strategies playing out over multiple years now uh and I think you our role is first and foremost we're a portfolio company we're here to uh serve Health Systems um but we have a role in GC as well as we're part of health insurance we're going to be deeply involved in the work at Suma um we're going to be involved in the work with

many of the other partners and health systems that General Catalyst works with and you know we have a team of forward deployed Engineers that with really a Swiss army knife in terms of the types of tools and pieces of software we have we can go on site and customize something for Suma or for a WellSpan or a ciny or wherever and I think what I'm most excited about is blending that custom engineering work with great products um and general Catalyst distribution and ecosystem all right well hopefully that gives you a

bit more of an idea about what Cur is up to tan on he is the CEO thanks for your time thank you
