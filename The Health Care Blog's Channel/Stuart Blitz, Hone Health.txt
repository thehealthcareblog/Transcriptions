Hi Matthew HT tcv Spotlight I'm here with Stuart Blitz from home health so uh those of you who've been hanging out on Twitter and Linkedin have seen probably seen multiple uh jokey post from Stuart about the the the kind of companies you think people should invent where he's always saying why is no who's working on this when in fact there have been 15 companies that tried that and failed it so we've been amusing each other on Twitter some he's been amusing me enough I've been amusing him on Linked In for for several years by this stage but uh in the background he was actually doing some work and uh a lot of that came up the last week when his company own health raised $33 million Stuart uh great to have you on here um first up uh why you how do you have all this time to do this tweeting it's my creative Outlet I think I think I you know I I work hard but then I sometimes I'm like you know I just have this like you know it allows me to exercise some creativity so there are a few people digal Health who are who

are good online and most of us are people like me and nil Krishna who don't actually have a real job you know um so let let's tell me about own health right so you are uh best known and I don't know I look at your website it's not entirely what you do instead of being the male Health equivalent of some of these female Health companies but I know you do female Health as well all the rest of it but as far as I'm aware you're basically an online Medical Group and Pharmacy for a bunch of stuff so tell me more about what are consumers right getting from on elf what are you supping what are you doing sure so so started the company uh about six years ago now I mean we've met years ago as you know like I've been in htech for a long time and so you Matrix for a while when you right I I was sunny Andre's first hire at aam Matrix like oh OG GE I don't know how you have so much hat I know um so um but yeah I mean and so and I was you know before sod and I came together uh you know I saw sort of like the Tre consumer 

model that that obviously Roman and hims kind of jumped in right and I was really enamored by it because I I just like over the years like one of the things I changed my mind on was I was like people are willing to pay cash for healthcare now not all pockets of it but but definitely some they want the convenience they they there all this frustration that we all know about and so my thesis was you going to see that model play out but in in patient populations that really just needed care being underserved and I didn't know which patient population to focus on and met my co-founder sod who as luck would have it uh was uh was kind of formulating what ended up becoming hone because but he came at it from the patient side so when he turned 35 about seven years ago he had all these symptoms and you know he's super fit works out six days a week eats well sleeps well he's like the the Pinnacle of health and so he uh went to his primary doctor and said hey I have all these symptoms like and listed them out and the 

doctor said this is old age sod I can't help you and he was like this is crazy like I I just don't like you know patients should know more about the health like I just don't believe you and so you know and I hear stories of all the time he went to his you know to spend a few months did some research found a new Doctor Who said s this is classic low testosterone like classic you know easy to diagnose he did a full set of labs and so he got on medication for low testosterone changed his life he like wait a second like I just found a doctor that understands what this is and so once that he had that personal experience he realized like hey wait there's probably a lot of other men out there like me right and so he um kind of was on his own kind of saying wait a second it's a really you know a third of men over 35 how have low testosterone highly underdiagnosed undertreated most primary care doesn't treat that like they just don't know about it they don't it's just something they don't used to and so we ended up 

as luck as luck would have it kind of came together we met each other and said oh wait a second we actually want to build very similar type of of companies and so we ended up launching our tele medicine offering uh just at that point just for men with loow testosterone in March of 2020 which you know I I feel like is well well chosen right like we we were just that wise to know when to to launch a tele medicine business um and so you know as just kind of luck would have it you know we launched massive need and you know people couldn't leave their homes and so we uh just grew tremendously and so we quickly kind of had to say wait a second now we've got to build the operations and build everything it is such an incredibly complex business because we're providing really complex Medical Care through tele medicine and so there's a lot that comes with that so we started off just serving men with low testosterone um spent a few years doing that building out the technology building out sort of all the infrastructure 
we needed to do that make the experience really great and then as you know a lot of people always asked us and we always said yeah we're going to expand it just we wanted to kind of get everything right in this very narrow patient population first and not small population but you just want we just wanted to treat that uh we expanded to do weight loss thyroid uh because again men could come in and they might come in and say hey have all these symptoms that look like low testosterone but actually they needed to lose some weight or actually actually going with their thyroid so we wanted we wanted the Physicians to have just a lot more data to decide what's the best care for them and then we I mean I always got to ask this question they're like why are you only treating half the population and we always said like look we always we want to get to treat women because it's it's there's very similar sort of I would say characteristics of this population but for PR menopause and Men menopause women experiencing 

P PR menopause and menopause same thing um and so we uh launched uh for women uh last fall uh because again you're seeing very similar characteristics both men and women trying to go to Primary Care have these more complex longer term issues Primary Care traditionally is not really well equipped to deal with sort of longer term problems and those patients getting frustrated with how do I get my care and so that's kind of where where where we sit yeah and I think you're you you're hitting on something that has been if you look at that you're hitting on something that's been I think well well documented right and hasn't really had much of a solution until but if you look at the number of companies who are trying to do tele Health only in general they are looking at people who have not not got what they want and there's a whole bunch of reasons for that from the current Primary Care system or or getting The Specialist or what have you um or it's people who there aren't very many of who primary car dox and 

specialist don't see a lot of but if you can aggregate these people get into the right specialist you can do something about it um and then of course you've got the sort of third part of that which is and this goes for both what you're some what you're doing but also for things like the uh you know the the the the full body scan types where there's not you know consensus in fact there maybe consensus amongst the medical establishment that this stuff is is real so I bet you know s doctor is not at least un usual saying well you know you're 35 your testosterone goes down just get used to it you know um and same thing with people say you know I getting this argument all the time right with people like well should you do full body scam well we do pick up people who've got early prostate cancer the other but also we're doing a bunch of we're seeing a bunch of false positives and all the rest of it so which gets me into the s next question of of the business model right so now you as you mentioned row and hims 

who've been you know doing find this Forest a little bit uh for quite a while here have been have gone down the path of saying this is low enough cost that we can build this a cash only business and not have to deal with getting on you know getting on the the insurance company's uh uh provider list and figur out what the co-pay is and all the stuff that that complicates the average uh uh people getting to the doctor at the same time as many many more people are going into these high deductible plans where they don't actually I mean I know my family we never got got was eight grand or something last year we never even got there so kind of was irrelevant whether or not effectively cash pay yeah it's effectively cash pay um and then there's and we're getting less information about what the thing costs when we go into a particular situation of course so talk to me a bit about how you position yourselves how you think about the evolution of that sort of cash pay business around certain disease conditions 

especially lower cost ones so where where all cash pay I think what you said you know I talk to people I feel like I've talked to people on Twitter all the time about this I I just think and I I'm trying searching for data to help me like help kind of prove it I just think like we pay more out of pocket for healthcare every year just the reality right just based on anecdotal evidence right look at your case right like having it deductible so you're just paying a bunch of cash for stuff right and I think that uh I think it's just happening year over year we're paying more in premiums we're getting less out of it our deductibles are going up and so we're just having more choice about where to spend our money right and so and I think you couple that with areas of care that are I would say more traditionally paid out of pocket and I think that's where you that's why I think you're seeing a lot of of businesses that are doing really well serving this patient population right and I contrast that with like if 

you're doing something maybe that's traditionally more medical like you know Cardiac Care and by the way there's some great cardiac companies as well too but like it's there it's probably a little harder to pay cash from a traditionally like you know very deep you know things like that but I think for for a lot of the population is looking for help with low energy and low libido and you know brain fog and like all these things they're like it's not an easy answer they they're they're used to spending money in this type of care and so if you can make it affordable for them um in a way where they're getting this care at home they're seeing a physician that deeply understands what they're going through I mean part of I think why people really love coming to H is that we just we have a really deep uh you know group of Physicians that understand how to treat this like they're not the physician that you go to that says oh just you know like sad doctor ignore it right these are Physicians that have years and 

years of treating this patient population so they really understand and they see other people go through this and so we've you know we have just stayed in this this cash world do we eventually go down and take insurance it's something that we're we're looking at that you know I think we definitely want to do we just felt it was more important frankly to kind of expand the areas of care that we're treating uh weight loss thyroid Women's Care that was something we wanted to do first and that's what we decided to do and I think patients feel that you know if they're feeling a lot better they just stick with the program because they're they're getting care that they they really need so what are the typical patient experience with hone looked like um so I'm I'm going back to all the way there was a company which I forget the name of the came the health 2.0 jeez might not have been might have been last decade might have been the decade before that which was doing 2.0 is like you know like you know it was it's 

receding far far into the Mist even for me I'm the one who remembers the most about it um yeah sure I mean h is H was created long after Health Dupo was gone um so you could never have been on the stage not my stage anyway uh but I mean I'm thinking about there was one which was one of the very first s online pharmacy selling fire basically right and and uh actually had a little little study that came I forget the name it was in Utah had a little study that came out and was saying you know compared to the typical experience of someone going to a primary care doctor they actually got more information they had a better patient history they because they were doing stuff you a row and then you had folks like lemonade which ended up in 23 me doing sort of stuff for contraception bills and what you know a bunch of people G this part how could you formulize a particular thing but it tended to be a thing that was either very routine like my getting my contracep every month or no Labs required no Labs required or 

or a or or more of the more of the you know I'm having a I'm a bit of issue and I got a party coming this weekend can I get simp right so I guess the question is what's the experience more like for a current home client is you know some as you said requires Labs requires so that the experience is you'll go and you'll get a full set of labs done that's it like we we really start there because without having that data The Physician really it's they can't you know the types of things we're treating requires a full setle app so they go do that um most of the time they're going in person to get a you know lab cor request or whatever it is and um once they have those labs they do a pretty extensive medical intake so again we're really digging into your to your history to learn really you know how have you been experiencing you know what have you been experiencing what symptoms you have you know how long you had them and really I would say going deep to answer you to get all the information from the patient and 

then the then the patient will then meet with a physician who has a anywhere between a 30 and 45 minute consultation with the patient so it's very very different than going to your you know saying calling your primary care doctor up saying I need to see them they say great I can get you in three weeks from Friday you go you know you wait three weeks you go in you wait there in that little room cuz they're running behind you spend extra 15 minutes waiting and then they come in they're rushing cuz then they got to catch up with the next appointment they're looking for some very quick you know hey oh I've got this cough let me you know me just put a you know test out a couple things and then give you some you know here's a prescription and off you go um it's a really deep sort of consultation where the physician's really covering a lot of things they're looking at your Labs they're explaining to you hey here's what your Labs mean here and and now you're these symptoms here's what it could be and they're 

really going into that with you and then the output of that consultation is really okay if there are you know if the physician decides that that you might need one or more medications great then you could sign up for a membership with homeone which then will you know pay for your your future labs and your and your and your physician visits uh and then you'll pay for that medication on top of that whatever you need and we can have it shipped to your door so um what's and then in terms of of follow up continuation but something something like that long-term chronic condition like you know low te might be or whatever um what happens next with those patients what's the connection back so those those patients you know get the medication they'll start on that medication and then um they come back for the first year every every 90 days so they'll do another lab test another visit every 90 days typically after the first year that can be every six months um once you're kind of dialed into the medication that 

you're on but it but it depends on the type of medication that you're taking what the physician wants um but it's it's really I would say there's a lot of there's a lot more I would say there's a lot more back and forth between the physician and the patient because you know if if you're if you're looking for a overthe counter Medic or not over counter a prescription medication that's you know like you know edms or or or contraception or whatever typically what you see there is you know the patient will do that intake form or that you know fill it out reviews it prescribes something and there's pretty little you know like the patient gets it and they just use it right it's a pretty easy thing with the medications we're prescribing and the journey we're trying to help the patient with there's a lot more there a lot more we want to provide a lot more check-ins with the doctor to make sure that they're not having any side effects that they're improving that maybe they're and and as you're treating more 

conditions you're seeing that Physicians really want to weigh in more because basically um they may want to you know adjust a longer term plan the other thing I think about our program which is attractive is our physicians are kind of like providing more of a a longer term view into to your care for example right so it's a little bit less like hey Matthew you need X medication right now I'm gonna give it to you and then great I'll you know maybe I'll see you later maybe I won't our physicians are really saying hey I think here's what's going on Matthew I think I I think you need to try this medication now I it's going to help with these symptoms that you have come back to me we'll see in 3 months or 6 months maybe then we you don't need that anymore you can take a different medication for something else that you have and so I think that our physicians and our sort of like philosophy is taking a more longer term view of how we can really help you improve your health um you know reduce your symptoms and 

just be thinking about it with more longer term lens than than a more you know short-term fix for for a particular medication so in terms of uh what you're offering you're offering a whole bunch of different kindies of medication what's the rough bullar monthly cost for y ones and then where are I mean you started with testosterone so I assume that may be still your biggest seller obviously I want start told you at some point about gop1 and weight because that's isue but let's just give me a rough flavor of what does it cost and how many what share of patients are doing what at the moment yeah it's a good mix I mean obviously you know I was on average patients are paying out of pocket around all it $220 $230 a month for for everything uh basically patients pay us a membership which could be anywhere from $19 to $149 $149 a month and then they pay for any medication they need on top of that um and you know again one patient might need Less in medication one one person might need more uh it's really it's 

really up to them but they just pay for whatever they need see and roughly I mean when you're talking about that are you seeing patients multiple medications or some coming for testosterone some coming for gp1 some it really all over the map and especially as we've treated now gone to treat women with P menopause and menopause there's a variety of medications so it really just depends sometimes you might uh maybe you are a patient For Whom The Physician says Hey testosterone is appropriate for you but then you might need another medication to help manage your estrogen um or you know typically a lot of times for treating low testosterone um a lot of medications typically medications use is something called chopine citrate right and so you might just get that it really is kind of all over the map uh and but we we try to have you know a lot of options for our physicians to make it easy for them uh to be something that hey because a patient needs this then we can provided for them with our for our with our 

partner pharmacies so let's talk a bit about weight loss uh the reason I bring this up is that if you look at you know the the big Guna in the space which is hims right they've obviously made a big play around gop1 you guys are offering as well uh and combat some some glutide uh and it seems to be that's you know I don't have their internal numbers but the numbers they're showing seems to be the large increase in profits and large increase in uh Revenue as they started doing that shows there's a lot of demand for that right um a lot of demand for GOP 1's obviously some of the most expensive can't pay out a pocket you get the compounded uh are you I mean you're saying what I'm seeing are you seeing something similar happen to your business in that area yeah it's a good question so you know we we added uh you know we added some of those weight loss meds but it's not a I would say it's not a focus for us like our our business is our business is is less around hey I need to lose weight I've seen on the news 

these medications are really appropriate I'm going to Google you know glp1 tele medicine find a a company and get my medication right they I feel like that's that's very often the case right the way we view it is right it's just one of many medications I'll give you a perfect example right you might have a patient come in or a man come in whose testosterone is low and their BMI is 42 right and so it's really up for the physician and for you know our uh to decide hey for this particular patient uh let's decide what's appropriate here I'm not a physician but like I I know kind of as as i' I've learned you know some patients that they might The Physician might say hey I actually want to get this patient before I get this patient treated for low testosterone I want to get their weight down they're going to you know get their weight down they'll exercise more they'll have more energy and then we'll see how they're their hormones are doing right versus other people versus I've heard kind of some from other 

Physicians who are like hey you know what I want this patient's uh testosterone to get higher because then they're going to have more energy they're going to have solve a lot of the symptoms that they're having then they'll have more energy to go work out and they'll have more energy to kind of do some of the things they want to do to kind of reduce their weight it's not a one-size fits all thing and so I guess the way we think about it is those medications are just a tool that we want Physicians to have and to decide what's appropriate for each individual patient so a little bit different than if you look at the sort of the market that's pure weight loss which is hey I know I need to lose weight I want to try these medications I wanty I want a a more convenient way to do that and so let me go find a company that's doing that so which guess is s sort of the the I guess the big Guna for a company like yours which is um patient acquisition right so obviously uh row him I mean him appar is about to drop a 

you know 8 million bucks on a Super Bowl out have dropped the 8 million already and have made the super B that lot of back and forth about about this the other about it but I mean you know I guess the question the question is there are a lot of patients out there but how do you find them how do you get them so what's your what's been your strategy towards doing that yeah I mean there's there's no question right there's a lot more companies looking at the space I mean look at sort of like hormones long longevity like there's a lot of companies that have raised money that are that are doing stuff here um and so you know like I think at the end of the day it's it's you're seeing a lot more companies competing for patients right now I think the Market's going to continue to grow but I think you're seeing a lot of the competition I also think that I think it's it's as we've experienced right like I've been through this now for five years it's it's a really hard complex company to build at scale and I think 

you're seeing a lot of dollars flowing into to acquire uh patience for newer companies and companies just starting out which there's tons of market right I get that like I I think it's I think it's something that's you know we all see the same thing highly underdiagnosed highly undertreated let's jump in and solve that but I do think I think it's really hard for companies to build infrastructure at scale that can deliver really high quality care and I think you're going to see a lot of companies sort of like acquire customers have to go build a bunch of stuff because it mean you know if if you have 500 patients you can probably manage them with a Google sheet right I mean I'm being a little phys but I mean you you you know it's just not that many when you start scaling a bit more you have to have a lot of really complex infrastructure and so it gets it gets really challenging but I mean there's there's no I mean I I think you know we're experimenting like like a lot other companies are right there's other 

channels you can acquire acire our patients in we have a pretty active community on our website and you can go to our website and you see a lot of patients talking all the time about medications they're on what should they try what's working for other people which is great we love that right and and we sometimes have people that are there that aren't own customers but they're getting feedback and so we kind of want to want to to um promote that so but just like everybody else we're we're experimenting with a lot of things all the time because we know we have something that's really attractive to this patient population that has these needs how can we Ser it I'll tell you the thing that I I it's we early days we just launched the women's program but I'll tell you which I love I saw a patient the other day who uh women uh women woman patient who came to us to get care her husband's a patient uh and so he loves hone and getting great help feel so much better so I I I think I I put into the to the company 

slack that I love having a zero doll acquisition uh patients that we get coming in so so I mean but you know well I mean that's that's great let's go to the shock tank sort of question by this right which is you know when when they're always when they're always saying that so so how what what do the cost you to get a customer and how much does the customer worse at what point you know how long do you keep them I guess yeah it's a good question I would say like you know we don't like generally speaking I think that if you were and we've experienced this with our patient base if you have a clear need for this medication The Physician kind of says hey you need this medication I I really I think you'll feel better you're feeling a lot better you love your home phys you love the convenience of the program you're just kind of Happy you're not really you know and I think it's it's it's a it's a different offering than uh just a medication you're getting in the mail right because I mean I mean I don't know I 

mean I look through the hyms financials like everybody else does I mean you know they come out every four times a year but like you know you look at at other companies and you know if you're buying something that's you can kind of the switching cost is pretty easy I'm you know the retention those companies is obviously a lot less right because I might decide hey I'm getting Ed meds from this company today and next there's a promotion I'm going to I'm going to get it from a cheaper price I think generally you're seeing companies that offer these more complex care to to patients and they're really happy they stick with you they're just really happy to stay which is which then makes you know comes back to acquisition numbers like you you know you kind of it's it's okay to spend money acquiring patients because they're gonna they're just going to be with you for a while uh and do you have a number for how long the typical male patients been with you it's um you know it that's not something you know we kind 

of look at it in terms of like I think generally speaking if patients are really happy we just see a lot of them sick with us like you kind of look maybe 18 months out you're just going to see that kind of you know you kind of see it Flatline like you just see patients really really want to stick with you because at the end of the day they're getting great care and they like it I I will tell you they have small numbers I love every now and again I'll hear from some of our first couple of patients that that actually joined us in March of 20 and they're still on the program program uh which I which I I love hearing from because I'm like wow you were literally with us from the beginning coming up on five years ex so you've been doing this stuff a long time around around Healthcare as I mentioned at the start there's kind of this burgeoning trend of can you build the online Clinic that deals with whatever it is you know migraine hormonal Health whatever um and it's based around aggregating demand across you 

know wide part of the country um or all country in some cases and you're seeing people still try to do this in kind of different types of Pediatrics and mental health and all you know all all across the board uh you've got a few companies the largest sort of online offline and one medical is obviously the big example who are trying to do Primary Care in that kind of way and making a slightly nicer experience I'm a one medical member it's a nice experience I wouldn't say it's necessarily the greatest overall Healthcare but you know it it kind of works um and then you've got you know a few who 've gone down the path of doing can we do Primary Care you know for specific groups like women or lbgt or folks and then you've got the world the mass of people out there either independent primary care or in Health Systems right whatever flavors what's your sense you know and and those people are not immune to looking at this Market many of them are doing deals with one medical to try to improve the sort of consumer 

front end funnel of what they're building any they're going to make money on the surgeries and stuff that happens inside what what's your sense of how all this is starting to play play out do you think that there'll be rebundling of stuff like yours back into bigger systems or do you think this becomes a sort of bigger independent segment or you hit a barrier where you you know at some point there's no more cash pay patients where are you going with this it's a it's a really really good question because I feel like right you you always see like this trends of like unbundling then bundling unbundling then bundling it's just like that's always happens in many Industries not just Healthcare I think that you're seeing this if you look at Primary Care today you're seeing a lot of patient dissatisfaction with what they're getting right it's kind of become this more transactional Urgent Care type of thing I think you're seeing the business models aren't great right if I just look at the other side of you right

it's like low margin got to always be available like they're not really attractive businesses so I I do Wonder are you know Health Systems going to look and say hey I you know this Pati population that is looking for help with heir hormones or their weight or their thyroid or or menopause they need more like they're the ones I want to get so let me let me go and kind of build or buy or or expand my care offerings there because and then conversely right like we've thought about that too like as we're treating more things around you know hormones and weight and thyroid maybe there are other things that we do and so you then you kind of more look like well this is you know more going down this spectrum of like a bit more down the primary care path and so like you know it's a hard Spectrum though right because on the one hand you have this very high high need right very narrow High need that you're willing to pay money for and you and you need regularly then the other side of the spectrum it's I can do 

everything but you know I might need you infrequently and then it become then it's like not a great business and so it's like we on the spectrum is kind of like the optimal from a hey we can build a business that we can then survive and be able to you know hire Physicians and and provide care but on the flip side then it's also like enough of a a broader care offering that's entering for patients and so like I don't have a right answer around that but I just think you're see you're seeing that Spectrum kind of companies move up and down that spectrum because I think that's kind of that's kind of what you're seeing within the Spectrum where where you are if I look at your offerings now and him starting to get you know you you come some different places but you starting to get more more similar seeing mini on the menopause a bunch of people who are now well funded right got a little bit of money quite well funded you know even better fun than you are now but but if how many in that world that independent 

cashay World um yeah you have a ton of weight offerings you have a ton of people you've never heard of who haven't got well funded but are doing you know online online I online G on will have you there's a lot of Fraud and Abuse and some part of that business but ignore that for a minute um how many how many companies do you think survive how many you know yeah it's it's a good question I just I just generally think that the total number of patients and the amount of care that's needed is going to go up every single year like that market Contin to grow a lot now does that exactly match with like how many of those companies survive it's a great question right because I feel like you're going to have I think you're going to have a lot of companies that that sort of like grow and they're they're at a certain scale and they're they're providing that and you're always going to have some smaller companies I think it's um I wonder in the future you're going to see more you know a number of bigger companies and 

a lot of smaller ones very but fewer in the middle I think it's because I also wonder like if you look at the or it's going to take longer to get there because I think if you look at like the tech enabled Services sort of you know VC backed world you know you obviously had a lot of sort of the you know the the Gold Rush times in the you know 2019 and 2020 and then it all just sort of died right in 20 22 I think right and so going2 and I think you're seeing that it come back a little bit but not to the level it was back then and I think you're seeing more of a careful eye to hey I need to build sustainable businesses and so I need to to focus on that so I I wonder I wonder if you're going to see a uh a good number of sort of pretty sizable companies versus like you know a lot of middle-size companies probably see a lot of larger a fewer number of larger ones but I think you're going to see multiple right like I don't I I look at like you look at the at the you know women's market right I mean there are so 

many women that need care that midi can serve that we can serve that there's you know a zillion others can serve and I think and you see it all the I mean I'm you know talking to a number of our patients our initial patients and you're seeing the same thing I went to my primary care doctor they said hey uh don't worry about these symptoms they'll you know they'll pass went to my OB same thing or hey you know you should try this medication but I don't need to prescribe these medications and the same thing women are frustrated they're looking for who is out there that can provide this sort of like really deep knowledgeable care and I think you're going to see a lot of companies that are successful because there's just so many people that need these type of care all right so to to wrap it up let's talk about the sort of state of play with uh you guys that have health right now give me a flavor of the sort of run rate for number of patients you're serving give me an idea about uh um whether whether you know 

you just raised a chunk of change um in that last round 33 million that last round uh just just announced this past month but I mean give me a flavor of how many people you are how many CS you have in the system kind of the SI the size and scale you're at and where you think you're gonna have to get to yeah so so we have about 100 employees in the company um I think we've been one of the things one of the things that I'm probably two things I'm really proud of one we've done it I think really efficiently we've just we've grown the company in a really efficient way used a lot of technology to help us scale and sort of build the tools that we need two um we built our own Physician Network uh and so we have you know we have 100 Physicians that are seeing patients all the time right so it's it's a pretty it's a pretty it's grown to be a good siiz Network I think one of the things I'm proud about too is we have Physicians that have that have treating our patients near from near the beginning and they're still 

really happy and so I really I would say deeply grateful for that because I think they feel supported and they love this patient population and I think and in turn they do a great job they have this deep experience that's great um and so for us the focus if we look forward right we think about hey how do we go from here I think we've established that hey we are really sort of leaders and experts in hey how do you treat low testosterone but I think we want to expand that and really be known as you look you know in the future for longevity care and other types of care that's coming in hey how can how can we as a as a company and as as a as a medical practice a t medicine clinic uh bring those things in to provide more offerings to our patients and I think kind of the way we look at it is we really want to be known right we think about both men and women we really want to be known as hey I am 30 you know 35 and older I have these symptoms I really want to know hey hone really is leading the way in terms of 

the care providing we want to get into looking at you know getting data on hey how are we how are we improving People's Health right like by you coming all these symptoms and then we you we treated you how are you doing several years later we really want to be at the Forefront of that because I think that it's not something that you traditionally see from tele medicine right I think tele medicine over the last decade has evolved to hey how can I can I solve this short-term need which by the way I'm a big fan of I think there's tons of short-term needs that actually been really you know tons really big businesses have been built but we really I would say we really want to be develop hone to a to a to a name that people know they're getting getting really high quality Care all right that's a great way to end it and I'll be looking for those clinical studies and M more segments as the years drift on all right I know with Stuart Blitz he is the COO of Home Health they just raised $33 million and you just 

heard what was all for and uh you know where they going where are we going to go in the future um so most of it split between I think Super Bowl ads and clinical studies if I got that we're not we're not we're not big enough for Super Bowl ads yet so well I get the last big Healthcare company that raised money and did a super lab was Q health and they've been they were out of business less than two years later so perhaps it's not necessarily the the greatest TR record all right well much thanks for your time do it thank you
