Hi I'm Matthew h this is another tcv Spotlight and I'm talking today with Katherine sonus Katherine is an MD who is the co-founder of flight Health which is in the Obesity space um so I supose she hangs out with a lot of people like me need to need to go on a dart and figure it all out so uh Catherine uh obesity medine right something that you're a specialist in uh and have been working on for many many years I know you the fellowshipping it all the rest of it uh become very trendy in recent

years uh to figure out what we're going to do about this for 35 years it's well I could tell America basically ignored it and then all of a sudden you know we've seen in the last decade decade and a half a lot of different sort of ways to to start thinking about it Beyond kind of what Weight Watchers did um so first things first tell us about why you decided to go into the you know into the startup business to deal with this rather than just work as a as a clinician I'm not saying we not working

as a clinician but you know why a startup rather than just becoming a an OBD specialist as there are many in America sure well Matthew thank you so much for having me I'm really excited to be here with you today um uh yeah so I got into the field of obesity medicine um right out of medical school um when I was in medical school my mentor Dr Lu Ron gave a talk about obesity and none of us had learned anything about obesity in medical school um I knew then that I wanted to go into this but at the time everyone was like what are you going

into why do you want to be a diet doctor what's obesity um it was just so early on um and then I did a fellowship at Cornell um while Cornell where I did all my medical training um after my fellowship I joined the faculty and I very very very quickly had a very long waiting list um and at the time my husband who is the more entrepreneurial one although now we are both entrepreneurial um he recognized the tremendous tremendous opportunity to help so many more people um you know at the time he said oh my gosh you guys

have this deep expertise that you know very very few Health Care Professionals have and millions of people need your help and um there's so much more we can do um you know at the time I was one of the first 20 fellows in obesity medicine in the entire country I was the first at Wild Cornell um and my mentor Dr Lou was one of the P pioneers of the field and so you know we were in a smaller group of PE of providers who really knew how to do this um and we were doing it really well and so um after a couple of

years of of practicing at Cornell at The Faculty practice um we teamed up with Dr rone and started the company to really scale and democratize access to the kind of very highlevel very effective um medical obesity treatment that we were we were uh um delivering so I like the idea not an uncommon one you know instead of touching the maxxim number of patients you can touch during a day or or or a year you can touch many more if you can figure how to scale it um obviously there have been many many attempts to uh

figure out how to deal with with ob B City and uh if you just look at the numbers they haven't made a lot of impact Hope on mass I'm sure theyve made individual impact but you know we've had Weight Watchers and a bunch of diet sites around for forever and you know Americans have got fatter and fat well you more and more Americans become obese over that time um you know everyone talks about oh you go back to Europe you lose 20 pounds just eating the food and you come back here and you put it back

on them I must admit that's happened to me a couple of times so um I guess the question is what works that you want to scale on the P of how to manageing obesity um there's a lot of different things obviously we have these drugs we may you may have heard of called ones we have uh different types of surgery you have obviously different types of program you have the sort of typical Weight Watchers approach of you know of weigh-ins and sort of Community Support what works yeah great question um first of all it's really important to kind of

take a step back and recognize that you know obesity used to be considered just sort of a lifestyle problem that people were eating too much exercising too little and that was it and so the solution can I can I ping you there people are eating too much and exercising too little right I mean that's not a myth well but we know know that it's much more complex we know that there's a huge genetic component we know that obesity is a disease because there are disregulated hormonal Pathways that drive people to eat more um and so it's

not just eating too much exercising too little it's everything that kind of leads to it and then what propagates it I actually recently did a TED Talk that explains the whole science behind obesity so um that's a good place and we'll we'll link to that in the notes but good perfect so that's a 11 minute overview of why it's so easy to gain hard to lose why it's a disease um so it's important to recognize that obesity is a a serious you know heterogeneous chronic disease and for most people just

being on a diet and exercising will not lead to significant and more importantly sustained weight loss so if you take a look at the very very very best lifestyle programs um the average weight loss is about 3 to 5% which is a little bit but not generally enough for people to improve health outcomes and then when you take a look at what happens after that initial weight loss 80% of the weight is generally regained within 5 years so lifestyle interventions in and of themselves do not work in a significant and sustained way for

treating obesity and so with oh go I was just going to say when whenever I've lost any weight regaining it within five years like five minutes but you know there we go yep yes well we can definely talk after after this interview about other treatments but so your question is you know what what works um and what works is really figuring out you know what does somebody's obesity look like you know everybody has a different version of the disease and so understanding what has led to their obesity and what has prevented that

person from treating their obesity first of all is the most important step to just do an evaluation and figure out like what is going on and then once once we do that and address everything that can be addressed we optimize dietary strategy optimize physical activity and then we treat medically and so that's where medication surgery other you know Advanced treatments come into play and that's what's really needed for the majority of people with obesity to treat their disease effectively okay so give

me some rough breakdown percentages about who buckets into which category you mentioned so like can we get people eating right and excise ing which like it's really hard everyone knows that that kind of behavior change really hard then figure about other other stages of interventions so roughly if I want you get I want the funnel roughly who gets referred into flight Health you know what level of obesity how much overweight I don't how you define you know who who's going to who who you need to start treating and then of those how

many can you manage with with the D and exercise how many do you need to get into Medical Treatments so what kind of treatment are you using yeah the question the numb are very easy by the time most people see an obesity specialist like me or come to a practice like flight Health they've tried and failed everything and nothing is working um and so we only see people who have obesity or have overweight with medical complications of their weight so we don't see people who have normal weight and they're trying to lose 5 pounds we

only see people who are really good candidates for medical intervention and because most people have tried and failed a million things over the years um I you know 99% of them are very good candidates for medical treatment like a medication so you know it's very rare that we see a patient who's never tried anything if that's the case maybe we would you know do a couple months of you know some sort of Lifestyle intervention before starting medication but you know the the guidelines really recommend

starting medication off the bat because it's not that the treatment is to treat the underlying disease you know the diet and exercise are more important for health and less important for for weight loss it's really the medical treatment of the disease that leads to significant and sustained weight loss okay so let's talk about what flight health is doing um first off describe you know who you are selling the service to who the end payer is how do people get find you as opposed to finding a random obesity

doctor if they could do that or ending up looking for some weird thing on on online which gives them you know pills of pills that America's Frontline doctors are selling them for weight loss and you know deworming or something you know there a lot of that going on um how do they find you and then what is the process like for a patient when they come on on board sure um so we mostly work with employers and Health Systems so for example we'll talk about this a little later but the state of Connecticut is our largest employer we

also work with other employers around the country um and we work with um a number of Health Systems and so if someone um is an employee of a company that works with us they are able to see us as part of their um employer benefits if someone is part of a health system that works with us same thing it's it's part of you know what is their their program and what are their offerings we do see um many people who come to us directly we still you know have so many referrals from our wild Cornell Network in New York City um and so we're in

network with many plans in New York Connecticut New Jersey um and we're in all 50 states but we may not necessarily um be in network in all those 50 states unless there's there's a reason for us to get in network so people find us mostly from their employer from their health system and sometimes directly we have tons of referrals from you know patients who've done very well their friends their family members their co-workers all will you know come and seek out the same kind of care okay um so they so they arrive uh somehow it's a

cover benefit so I don't know what the level of costs are and assume there are different benefit structures but um what happens next so now I'm on the intake how do you go through the process of this is mostly this is all remote I understand so how do you go through the process of figuring out um who needs what what is the proc what what is what is the uh the patient evaluation part who's doing it how much is automated how much is humans what kind of humans take me through the process yeah great

question um so we basically function like a very very high level Medical Practice um when we first see a patient they have gone through a pretty extensive intake um process where they have to submit um a large panel of labs if they've had labs done the last year that you know satisfies what we need wonderful otherwise they go to a lab have the labs done they also uh fill out a series of questionnaires or a health risk assessment so that we can have a good understanding of their their medical history so similar to you know

going to a new primary care doctor where the primary care doctor needs to know everything about you in terms of labs in terms of your overall health that's the information that we require people to provide to us before we see them and then our initial visit with them it's either a medical doctor an MD or a nurse practitioner and NP um who does that initial assessment and we spend an hour with our patients and the purpose of that initial visit is really to understand the version of that person's obesity so that we can get all the

information we need about every single factor that has led to the patient's obesity and every single barrier that has prevented them from treating their disease effectively once we get all of that information then we do a lot of Education we explain to patients you know this may feel like you don't have the willpower or that this is your fault but it's not your fault it's not a matter of willpower this is a disease and here's why it's a disease and here's what your disease looks like so will

explain you know you have a genetic susceptibility 40 to 70% of obesity is heritable and we will um go through all the contributors so many people have undiagnosed sleep apnea many people are on several medications that are causing weight gain so we'll address all of that and explain it to the patients then we talk about optimizing you know everything lifestyle wise so dietary strategy physical activity behavior um and then we will talk about Advanced treatments um and we don't jump straight to a gp1 for for most people because

there are so many obesity medications and because we have you know our team is all medical experts you know obesity experts who can use all of the tools not just prescribe a gp1 to everybody we end up prescribing you know in in a risk benefit you know way where we prescribe more conservative approaches first and then then escalate to a gp1 you know if and when we need to do that so I've got whatever treatment I've got maybe a medical one I don't know if you refer out to uh surgery bariatric surgery and

that kind of stuff as well but uh I assume you're not doing that over tell Health my my buddy Rog agal used to do this at uh used he used to do this at at at Jefferson and then somehow somehow quit that high paying lucrative job and went off and started his own startup he probably needs psychological counseling which you know maybe we can provide later um mean but uh what what happens next to the patient so they meet with that that first one yep so they have that first initial visit we start them on a treatment plan um and then we have

a Cadence of visits and it's really a whole it's a care team that's necessary for really good care so um they have their prescribing provider an MP or an MD or both and then also a dietitian and so they have touch points with you know one of their providers basically every month um and it's that first several months that are pretty high maintenance so they are meeting with one of um the providers on our medical team basically every month to assess their progress so if things are not working and we need to

change course we'll do that we don't want them waiting months and months and months and not making any progress if they're you know if they have questions if they have side effects if they have any issues we tell them you know to get in touch with us between visits but we have so many touch points at first to really fine-tune what we're doing so that we're able to you know minimize side effects we're able to really personalize our dose titration in a way where we can help people get to their

health goals before we then transition to the phase of of weight maintenance so those first few months are a little bit more high maintenance patients are checking their um their weight their blood pressure you know different um metrics in between visits so that can monitor them and see how they're doing and then we just continue to adjust adjust adjust until we reach their health goals okay a lot of stuff going on in there so number one is how do you work with their um primary care doctors if they have them you know basically are

you their primary care doctor for now h no no no I do not do Primary Care um we make sure at our initial visits that every single patient has their own primary care doctor because we don't do primary care what we do is is very specialized in terms of treating obesity but obviously you know we um affect blood pressure and thyroid and so we um we manage a lot of other conditions um but everyone has their own primary care doctor and so we communicate um with people's primary care doctors um so that we keep their um you know we have open

communication and you know we have um you know it's really important for us to have those relationships as well I understand that that's a thing everyone says they want to do that but in general that works very poorly in American Healthcare so what have you done to try to make that work better yeah so we send our notes to their primary care doctors we make sure that we have a primary care doctor for every single patient you know either before they come in or we make sure that they have one and so we send

our Communications back and forth and then if there's a need for them to reach out to us they know that they can do that any time or we'll reach out to them if there's something that we need to um we need to connect on okay um so let's get to the interesting part does it work what happens what happens to the the patients who come to you and what are the sort of results you're seeing and then you know say what happens is how many of men end up on gop1 how many of them get referred out to bariatric how

many other drugs and then what's the typical result that you'd expect to see yeah so I think what really differentiates us from other Solutions out there is that we have so much expertise that we're able to really customize our treatments and and figure out really personalized treatment plans so that we don't just depend on glp1 so many of our patients never even require a glp1 we have so you know huge percentage of patients who lose all the weight they need to lose to achieve their health goals on one generic

medication two three four you know our expertise is really in combining those medications to get excellent results um you know then a certain percentage of our patients are on gp1s and you know either they have a reason why we prescribe those off the bat or they're not responding to other treatments um and so we get really great results you know obviously our patients lose more weight on average if they're on gp1s just because they're more powerful effective meds but our um weight loss numbers um for patients who are not on

are very very very good as well um and it's you know in addition to the weight loss our our goals are really health outcome so improving or resolving weight related Health complications um and also greatly reducing the risk of developing other health related complications but can you give me some numbers what how effective it is on how many patients that you've seen give me yeah absolutely so um you know the state of Connecticut um is a is a population where many patients come to us after receiving care elsewhere or

they've already lost weight elsewhere so it's a very heterogeneous population many of them have many weight related comorbidities and many of them have already lost weight so we're not starting with a population like in clinical trials um so we are able to get you know over 16% um total body weight loss on average looking at Patients on gp1s and patients on um on uh generic medications okay so that sounds pretty effective what's the average percentage that someone needs to lose to to get to their goals in your population around

yeah a great question it's it's really all across the board it totally depends you know what medical complications people come to us on um you know if you take a look at you know data you know we used to consider 5 to 10% really clinically significant or sufficient for significant weight related Health outcomes um now because it's so much more achievable to help people lose 15% 20% 25% those are the new goals but we really customize it so I would say you know everybody loses more than 5 to 10% and then above that it just really

depends on their bodies their medical conditions that's great so I got two questions for you that are relevant so the first one is this is quite an intense process that you're talking about quite a lot of humans on your end um your goal here was to scale this millions of people right um uh other than hiring more and more absity Specialists and dietitians right how how is your how is this different other than Stell Health virtually person than what you're doing at well Cornell yeah great question you're right you know we when

we started our company um we were a SAS platform so we started with um we started with um software and so our software basically enabled other providers to provide this kind of care so our goal was to empower existing infrastructures to to democratize in scale we very quickly found out that most most health systems did not not have providers who had any bandwidth to take on one more thing and so we ultimately ended up you know starting our own Clinical Services that are powered by our software so basically um

we have the software as a standalone so we um use our software with Health Systems so that they can you know they can provide the care themselves so that's a way of scaling but then we also use technology we have patented algorithms we have you know a whole program that's been studied in clinical trials that powers our ability to provide Care at the highest level of our degrees and to save us as much time as possible on you know anything that we could be doing that could be automated that could be you know data that

patients provide us in advance that you know so we are using technology to enable us to see as many patients as possible even though we definitely have a team of um a large team of healthcare providers yeah you managed to say that whole sentence without using the pH without using the two letters AI which was very clever but I mean that this does seem to be one of those questions where and by the way where you know you enable me to use the buzzword of a AI n1's in the same interview which is very cool does seem to be an opportunity

where you know much like I assume there's a lot of couns thing going on here and all of nutritional counseling and stuff and how much of that is do you think over the next three to five one to three to five years whatever the numbers are they like you to be uh able to be to translator to take your nutritionist your people out of the program and put in AI type Avatar slash other information like that yeah so it's interesting as we're able to do so much more with machine learning with AI you know with with all of this technology um

it still doesn't replace the relationship with a care team and especially with obesity medicine um it's obesity is really tricky it's a really hard disease to treat and it's a hard disease to treat well and it's a hard disease to treat long term so we never anticipate you know completely replacing a dietitian or completely replacing a doctor or a nurse practitioner but again we're you're using technology as much as we possibly can to take away any aspect of our treatment that you know or we

don't need that relationship we don't need the personal touch um where we're just kind of collecting data and making you know uh medication recommendations to Providers um so it's it's not an area where we're going to see as much replacement of providers but can you give you an example about what kind of thing are you are you using are you are you helping your providers by giving them whatever with machine learning or AI can be yeah sure so we have um patented algorithms that we created when

we first started the company um that basically take in um Health Data take in Labs take in everything that we can feed it and make recommendation so for someone like me I can you know do this in my sleep I don't need that but for providers who haven't been doing this for so many years and need you know more handholding um the algorithms basically give all the recommendations to the patients and then another set of recommendations to the providers and specifically where a real you know IP lies is in the the medication decision

support so we have the technology that will say you know consider these medications use these medications with caution and do not use these medications um and then we have technology that you know follows and and you know makes recommendations as patients go on okay so essentially you you talking about upskilling the kind of practitioners you currently have on the upskilling and improving their uh advancing their that that level of of understanding as as quickly as possible so that there is some scale there I'll gr that okay last

couple of questions um you may have seen or heard that there are people selling compounded gp1s a lot of people are you know we obviously the the other big fuss about do they work and clearly they work and all their side effects and all that kind of good stuff and should we invade Denmark um other the other question appar we're going to invade Greenland why are we going to invade Greenland when when the expend when the valuable part of Denmark is c h i don't know but that's our we we will refrain from our

discussions about our president this morning um but the you know you the big issue is the cost right um which can vary and can be 1,200 bucks a month whatever for gop1 you can buy compounded stuff for now uh from online pharmacies for a lot less you know a few hundreds a month um how do you charge both for your services or what do you charge your employees for your services and when they're getting GOP On's on top how does that work out cost-wise um and then you know are you what is your stance about how the is

playing out given you know the ongoing cost of GOP ons and whether they should be used permanently or whether you can taper them off just talk to me a bit about sort of the cost benefit effect and how we are for the more expensive drugs how you how you are thinking about it yeah so we go through Insurance um we you know our our mission as a company is really to democratize access and because this is you know chronic disease management long-term management you know we don't want this to be expensive for the individuals and so when somebody

comes to see us and we're Network you know it's just like going to see a doctor you know we're in network they don't you know they pay a co-pay to C us and then we prescribe medications and we work very hard we have a large team um of people who do prior authorizations who do appeals to get you know medications covered if someone comes to see us through their employer then it's no charge to them it's an employer benefit so the employers pay you know per engaged member per month so that and

then when we have employer customers we still prescribe medications that go through Insurance um so everything we want to be as you know as you know as easy and inexpensive for the patients as possible of course we definitely have situations where we just cannot get a medication despite you know tons of you know appeals and everything that we try to do we just can't get what we want for patients and so you know there's still spotting insurance and then you know high prices and shortages there's so

many barriers to patients getting what they need um so we do our best and we're really handy but it's also just important to understand that like it's not just about gp1 it's like if we can't get a gp1 we have tons of backup plans of medications that we can get and we have the expertise to be able to get great results with non- glp1 medications on the glp one front are you seeing a lot of uh are you seeing a lot of different um broadly speaking he getting worse or getting better in terms of getting

access to that my impression is that there's more and more plants and employers are trying to cut it off rather than and then and then the second part of that question is what happens if somebody's been on it for a while and they have to go off to you know what's what's that do to their results yeah so I mean we're seeing States and we're seeing employers all over the country that have rescinded coverage which is really really horrible for the employees and for for patients because you know we

know they're going to regain some or all of their weight that they've lost so it's really you know it's not a good situation to have coverage and then lose it um and so what our differentiator is is that you know companies and states that have had to do that you know looking to us as in our model with the state of Connecticut we can do this in a way that's much more cost effective so that they don't need to they don't end up overspending and resending coverage you know it's better to be you know more

conservative on the front end like everyone says oh just prescribe gp1s and then deprescribe or get people off but that one doesn't work um and two it makes so much more sense to have a step-wise approach on the front end so we only have patients on glp1 who really need to be on GP ones to answer your question about what happens if people need to come off it's really hard it's not a good situation um and it's something that you know we all face because people lose insurance there shortages you know it's so many

different things can happen right now um and it's really not ideal so what we do when our patients lose coverage for any number of reasons is you know we switch them to Alternative treatments and again because we have the expertise to really you know prescribe other meds meds other than gp1s very well um we're able to make sure that patients don't regain all their weight what do you think about the compound of GOP ones do you think they're safe to use I mean because those are those are much Clos in price to what

somebody can manage out of pocket they're not cheap but you know you could probably do two to three grand a year you probably can't do 12 to 15 so uh what do you think that's a viable alternative I mean I'm just we're seeing a lot of companies really pushing that very hard and we know there's issues with whether there's a shortage or not or whether it's you know whether it's safe or not and El com off to people for their patient records and kind kinds of weird stuff but I mean do you think

that's going to be a longer term alternative um I have I have big concerns about the safety of of compounded so we as a company will will never do that all right cool all right uh let's tell me a little bit tell me a little about the company you mentioned I know you raised U uh was it 7 million bucks uh last year the year before last sometime very to be Rec tell me a bit about that you started in 2019 how much money you raised how big you are how many patients you treated just give me a flavor I we talked about state of

Connecticut but give me a flavor of where you are as an organization yeah sure so we are just about to raise our series B um so I feel very fortunate to have gotten to the stage of series b um it's very exciting um I think we have about a hundred or so employees at this point um and we've seen over 10,000 patients um since we started all right well that's a decent number how much did you rais in in was I right was it 7 million I think it ended up being closer to about 16 actually oh so uh when like

my weight when I get on the scale you know I'm only 7 pound oh I'm 16 pound over weight yeah okay that's that's uh that's that's great here so you raised a bit you're you're out raising some more at the moment you said all the series B is in process at the moment um and give me a the last thing I want to ask you is sort of there is a big aniply of companies in this space right so you've got we talked originally about you know the D sites that were online and and obviously the

people the modern version is selling the GOP 1's compounded you've got people like Amada and various parts of Leong and others who've been doing this for a while um inside you've got uh a bunch of other people playing around the in the Obesity space and then you've got you know the old classics like Weight Watchers um how do you how do you think this plays out I mean what what you know do do we end up uh with you know a few big players in this space and that they take a very medical approach like yours

in extreme situations and they either refer of you or they buy you or whatever um what do you think that the landscape of obesity companies looks like in a few years time yeah I think that's a great question and different things work for different people and so and you know millions of people have obesity so there will always be no shortage of demand is my understand yes no shortage of demand I've been to Disneyland no shortage of demand um but I I think you're right I think we are going to see some consolidation in the

space just because there's so many different solutions out there all right very good well I'm speaking to Dr Katherine sonus she is the uh uh uh co-founder chief medical officer and bottle washer at flight Health Katherine thanks for your time thanks so much for having me Matthew
