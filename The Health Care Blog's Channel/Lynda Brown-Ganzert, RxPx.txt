Hi it's Matthew hul another TCB Spotlight with a demo and this time I am with Linda Brown Ganer she is the CEO of rxpx um but a long time well quite a long time ago maybe a decade ago I met her when she was a CEO of curatio um which was a patient facing app uh helping the B patients with rare diseases and he came to health 2.

I can't remember which Year Linda but it was like you know it it wasn't 13 not in the zeros but it wasn't very recent um things have changed a little bit since then uh CIA was doing patient facing stuff uh was company called rxmx that was doing uh clinici facing stuff um tell us what creia did tell us what RX MX did and then tell us what happened next in 2022 yeah absolutely um well thanks Matthew so um curo the company that I founded uh was a social health prescription so we're using uh a bunch

of Technology to match patients to other patients that were going through a similar situation and then providing them with evidence-based Information Tracking tools to really help manage you know adherence and navigation so um that's you know I'm I'm par geek park connector and uh produced over I guess over a 100 digital products now in in my career and was very much looking at you know how do how can you provide that personaliz support to patients now funny enough um the same month same year but on a

different cont a group of doctors um that started a company called rxmx um were struggling with um you know keeping their patients safe so onboarding patients onto specialty therapies and making sure that they had all the information and the alerting and monitoring that they needed to um you know keep patient safe and so um it was actually a discussion with you Matthew uh so I have you I have you to uh to thank for this we were talking a couple years ago and uh I I think in not maybe a few more words than this you said okay

well what's next it's time for the next step right at that time Cy show was being used and never talk to me when I'm drunk in a bar or when you're drunk in a bar either yeah yeah exactly so you know at that time the cury show was being used in over 100 countries and 12 languages and I'm like yeah you know what you're right what is the next step and uh rxmx was thinking the same thing it's like hey we've got a wonderful solution that you know hcps love um and we're being asked for how we support the

patient um and so we brought those two companies together um it's about 2 and a half years ago now and it's been a wonderful marriage it's been you know one of those one plus one equals 3 so congratulations on that I'm still awaiting my 10% you know my give my Bitcoin address after the after the Call's done um but let let's dive a little bit into it so you were you said at that stage I think this is U uh uh 3 four years ago you're already being used in 100 countries um creatio you know had

spread a fair amount was being used by by patients give me a sense of the scale and size of what cre creatio was doing then versus um rxmx as it was then you know how big were those component parts how many people how many people were they touching how many doctors were on board you know how big were the companies at that point right well I mean I think I'd have to look back in the notes but you know tens of of thousands for sure on the patient side and and thousand on the hcp side and so you know now we're starting

to ramp up into sort of an add another zero to that but I think what's more important is there just hasn't been that end to end where it's one you know it's one flow for that that hcp that's on boarding the patient on a specialty therapy and for the patient that is then taking the specialty therapy so often we find our customers are like piecing it together or might have you know traditional with digital mixed in and um this just gives a nice end to endend flow um that both patients and doctors

love so let's go down to the people are paying and the people are using right people are paying primar primarily especially farmy far especially farmer so I don't know if your mixes between far pharmac companies themselves especially pharmacies who you know work for them on behalf of them um and or other organizations during that mix so who is paying and what's their problem and then just describe the experience of the patients who have to take these medications and how you're helping them yeah for sure so um we are a B2B SAS

model and we license the platform primarily to pharmaceutical manufacturers um we also have research organizations that are using our platform patient advocacy groups um large scale providers our health authorities um and starting to be used in clinical trials as well so that is the End customer and the Real Pain points that they have are around safety and adherence so we know that about 2third of the therapies that are going to be approved in the next 5 years um are going to be specialty therapies and those also often come with you know RS

and risk you know mitigation strategies that need to be in place um so the you know the end the the customer if you will is the pharmaceutical manufacturer that's bringing that therapy to Market and needs to have the safety and and uh monitoring in place along with the patient engagement and adherence um and the users are the hcps that are prescribing uh those therapies and the patients that are taking them so from the patient perspective um what is the why why would they I mean I get a farm you go to a farm manufacturer

and say Hey you know you've got a the FDA says if you're giving this expensive therapy you also have to monitor liver function or whatever and the doctor has to do it you've given the doctor tool to there from the patient perspective why would they sign up what's in it what's in it for them oh my gosh yeah I mean I me this is very close to my heart but uh um I mean it's a very isolating experience um obviously with any condition but you know especially those on on specialty therapy so you know

first of all they're dealing with isolation you know navigation where to find trusted information especially in this day and age where you know there's a lot of erroneous information out there um and just making the job of of being a patient easier right so you know whether that's tracking your appointments your medication or tracking side effects but what we come back to time and time again um is that social connection and so you know when we were building that piece of it we looked at Decades of research that

show that that you know that peer support um is absolutely imperative to you know reducing the isolation but interestingly enough has a really positive impact on adherence you know that sort of pure accountability or or relating um to others so what I think patients us they find most valuable is the is the connection and the support um but certainly um you know making those jobs that they need to do every day um a bit easier and just from the patient perspective they're getting obviously peer support they're getting a bunch of

sort of reminders and education and other stuff and they're also getting actual coaching on the platform actually there are your people on the platform as well as other members what's what's the rough Rao I mean I you quantify this the rough ratio in the patient experience between other patients are in the similar condition you know talking with them versus a more sort of an RN or a coach or somebody leading leading them through the P I'm very interested in this like connection between peer support versus professional coaching as

it were yeah yeah so every patient has an assigned Community manager which is a human um and that that person has experience in in the condition um is can be another peer like a peer mentor um but as often sometimes a nurse or a casean manager as an example um we use a hybrid human and Technology approach so we also have an AI buddy that is there from the beginning and along um the way with the the patient and it's much more than I mean we're seeing a lot of chat Bots right um and that's a very reactive and sometimes not

satisfying experience right um and so we've really designed you know the AI to be learning about what where that patient is in their Journey what they're needing trying to anticipate what they're going to need yet next and being proactive so it's not as much about the you know the patient saying oh you know okay chatbot can you help me with this it's about our AI buddy saying hey looks like you might have missed a few of these things you know would this be helpful so it's a it's a complete

paradigm shift in that way um but there are both humans and Technology um that are playing that role of support all right um well I think the thing you should do is take a look at it so uh can you fire fire up a quick demo you may remember this from 2012 or whenever you show the demo Al 2 f up let's take a look at the what our experience looks like yeah I think you're dating me a couple years uh older than I I I got to tell you lot of people say oh I remember seeing you health 2.

whatever that 2007 to 2019 period is a complete Mash blur in my mind I have no idea what was happening when um so what we're going to do is is just take a really quick look here at the hcp portal and this was very much um designed and informed by my co-founders and uh the the doctors neurologists uh that uh that helped you know design this um and so the first thing you see is you know as as a doctor I'm Doctor house here I'm signing in um at the top here you can see that I can group my patients this is really helpful um because

someone who's just about to come on to treatment is obviously very different than someone that is in uh maintenance mode um so I sign in and over here I see my little alerts and I go into that and uh I'm like huh okay got a little alert here from miles and uh what I can do is go into and see all the information here um but I can also go over and see any type of um you know treatment information patient consents documents um cumulative results this is one that gets used a ton because take look at this you know we can do some nice

graphing here um that really just gives the you know the HCB a bird's eye view and um and can help them uh acknowledge you know any types of incoming uh tests and things like that so this is um this is kind of the the home the home ground if you will for um for the hcps and there is a um a knowledge function here which is super important so that means um the hcp can set how they want to be alerted so do they want you know do they want an SMS do they want it to show up here and then they can also set delegates and what that means is if

there are others within their care team that can um uh that can acknowledge um and review the results uh then they can set those delegations and that's huge um for htps that are managing a lot of patients um they may be away um they want to be tracking a particular um you know patient aspect so this is a really important part um for them that they tremendously appreciate because it just streamlines that sort of entire um that entire workflow but if I go back to um and I just want to go back here but if I

go back to um my home base and I want to go in here and I want to add a new patient what what we're doing here so let's say we're we're on boarding um Sarah Thompson um so let's call the patient Sarah and um we go over the the uh you know the the consent obviously but we also have an ability to enroll them right into what is essentially the support program um so that sends a nice little you know single click um either email or message off to the patient so that they can um get started and then go

through and I rroll the patient and off We're Off to the Races and it's really as as straightforward as that so what we hear from um hcps is that what used to take them hours because we're pulling in information from labs and rims and the patient um the patient record so what used to take them hours and days sometimes to onboard a patient onto therapy is taking them minutes um another story I always like to tell is we had a you know a doctor that was out hiking on a Sunday um an alert on on um on his phone and that patient's um

platelets I believe were were dangerously out of range so was able to um you know not only acknowledge but action that and with our nurse team um connect with the patient right away you know got them into ER in a more traditional sense that information wouldn't be coming into the practice until potentially Monday potentially you know later in the day and would have caused um some you know some some serious effect for the patient so they really like that they have um they have control over how they want to be alerted

who they want to have alerted on their team and to have the views the comprehensive and holistic view of the patient um in the background no um just a slight silent for that you're in a bunch of different countries right um I note for the American viewers that it is not uh it's not uh um the 15th of the year it's the uh it's sorry it's not the fifth month of the year it's the fifth day um what's the different situation in how you get it how you're getting this data into the system I don't know how much

you're doing in the US versus Canada versus Australia versus elsewhere um but obviously data integration is a critical part of all that yeah yeah that's a great question so we do um a lot of integration in the back in the back end where we're required so when when we put this plat form together we never wanted it to be a Walled Garden um because you get into this Zero Sum kind of thing where it has to be our platform or nothing and we never wanted it to be that way so we look at where does that hcp on board where does that patient on

board anyway how do we integrate with that point of entry and then what are the aspects that need to be you know pulled in on the back end so that will vary from country to Country and different systems that are in place um you know and sometimes that means inte integrating more directly withes themselves um or with Labs um or you know even on on the health record side all right and uh where where are the right now where are the majority of the patients or they split between a bunch of different countries oh sure um

so the majority are in the US um Canada Australia um Germany um Switzerland parts of Europe and um and then really kind of sprinkled throughout the world okay okay um is there more on the uh physician side the hcp side you want to show me or do you want to switch over to the patient side I'll quickly switch over the patient side I could talk about the hcp side all all day but let me just uh show you a little bit about what Sarah's going to see now um because you'll remember we just onboarded Sarah

and so she's going to get a nice you know a deep link a QR code an email um and just come right into this and uh we do find most patients really um want the mobile experience and so um we very much focused on that we had desktop version we had about four patients on that so it was a clear indication um but we're gonna I'm actually the last guy hates doing stuff on my phone I R rather do it on my computer but I'm I've noticed yeah no it's interesting how much we're doing in the palm of our

hands there but um so this is Sarah and what we do right from the beginning so this is the AI buddy working in the background ground and and while these are pretty um um straightforward questions what this is really helping us understand is a little bit about Sarah's learning style um and we are continually sort of gathering that in the background and working with the patient to really understand um what it is that they need where they are in their Journey um you'll see this is the first place Sarah

lands and uh she's got a nice message here from her um Community manager Janet um which is uh which is a great way to start um so she's in here and she's onboarded um and then if we go into um this flashing part here is um so this is the AI buddy so we we've got a whole library of content um the sort of tagged to where you know where patients are in their Journey what would be appropriate what are they searching for um and so we can kind of go to that and take a look through here um but there's a whole

library of content that's evidence-based we also have a whole library of programs that we've developed with different um subject matter experts and clinicians um so this is really sort of the first part where where Sarah lands um and then we want to go over to um I'm going to go over to the uh sort of the Discover which is in the content here and then I want to take you through some of the the health tools so medication so this is um you were asking you know would the would the medication be um interchange between

the hcp and the patient platform and indeed it is so if Sarah's um um hcp has changed let's say the dosage or the timing it'll show up here um so that's a really nice functionality and you can see that Sarah's added some other um uh medications that she's on allergies um which I know something you're suffering from right now but Sarah's also added those in there so that's um you know part of um part of the uh the tracking tools but let's take a look through a couple of others

appointments are another important one um and especially specialty therapies where you might have to be doing things like you know weekly or monthly Labs or Imaging um so this again interfaces with the hcp platform um and we we also have you know both the AI buddy and humans in the background so if an appointment is missed um we can help out there um it can also surface up you know what's the closest um lab to you what's the closest pharmacy so using some nice location based uh aspects there um so that is um

sort of on the appointment side and then tracking is where um you know this is really all about the patient this is their own um dashboard and we have a whole set of trackers but they're um configured to each each condition and so it's really trying to give them um you know a a nice view of how they're doing um day-to-day which is helpful for those appointments um that they're doing as well we go into the Health Report you can see here especially around things like side effects um and we have built

um our our PV is is very much um Regulatory Compliance so the way that we are filtering and alerting to Adverse Events and then um processing them aligns with our customers um um procedures so you can see there's a you a nice view there of um whether it's non-adherence or side effects um that the uh the patient can track um and then share with uh with their provider and then similarly you know Health profile um again just a nice way to sort of keep information all in one one spot um so that's you know that's really where um

the patient is is providing um a lot of sort of input into managing their own health and where they're really um getting uh the benefit of of having that type of support and then maybe the last thing I'll touch on um because you sort of asked about it is it what's what's kind of unique here is this is um Sarah's private Circle so she chooses know who she adds into this and so we're running um a matchmaking system in the background we have a patented algorithm around that that helps match people not

just want condition to condition but Hobbies interests lifestyle to Stage um and that's really important because you know it's patients are holistic they aren't just their their their condition and so um this is where Sarah gets to um bring her Inner Circle of of who she wants and then of course she's a part of the overall Community here yeah fantastic what what is the so you know we took there's so much conversation has been for so many years about patient engagement right um so there you are you've got a probably some

horrible some unpleasant illness that you know requires one of these expensive long-term therapies you're pling yourself in the finger you're injecting yourself once a week once a month once a day whatever the number is here's this tool to help you what do you find is the kind of uptake rate of the tool and then what parts of the different things you're showing you whether it's tracking whether it's um tracking versus uh Community versus convers you know the the the transactional stuff with your

doctor what's the most what's the B the biggest hook that gets used the most it would be the um I think the role of the community manager um and that social aspect so that so that's sort of one to one and then participation in um in the community and then next would be content um and and then it depends on sort of your personality and so some people really want to track and are are very um sort of adherence focused and and others are maybe not so much and so we've started to build in some psychometric um uh

assessments and some assessments that help people better understand themselves and what support they might need um to that end we've also been integrating um some mental health support because um we've find that you know people overall but people living with a condition can often have some mental health challenges so in that order it's really like the it's it's knowing that you've got somebody on your team and is helping you navigate that you've got a community of people that understand what you're going

through and you've got a set of tools that are going to help you with the aspects of adherence that you might be struggling with no I mean I think that's that's what I would have expected and it's really fantastic and obviously you're not going to catch everybody you're not going to catch everybody you know not everyone who you have IIs to is going to get on the system but you know if you're going to have enough to both help the patient and also take some of the excess burden of other types of

communication off the patient provider relationship which is as you know a massive pain in the ass you know those phone calls and answering machines and you know staff time is is is really critical and I think probably as as you go I'm sure you'll be building more and more Ai and and tools into that because there are as you know 15 other well probably 200 other startups currently out there now trying to figure out how to do that communication around things like appointment times and God you know pre pre prior author prior authorization

and God knows what else so that's that's really that's really fantastic um is there that that's great is uh and then just the last thing before we left a demo but before we leave the demos this stuff shows back up in the for H hcp world right so the doctor or the clinician office is looking this gu okay well Sarah is now to made an appointment or they've sh their blood pressure information or what have you um does that is that something they look at of the separate screen does it come into

their EMR is it like a small on FL within their EMR how are they how are they consuming that sort of information coming back yeah so the medication Ando appointments are really key here and that's what's getting fed back to the hcps um that's where they also appreciate our fabulous nurses and our infomatics nurses and our community managers that in the are in the background along with the AI buddy that are are alerting or flagging and doing some of that back office work right so if somebody's missed a lab reaching out

and saying hey you know did did you need some help with rescheduling that or um you know you're overdue for this you're traveling you know really being that line of support um for the patient which to your point again takes the burden off the hcp and their team in tracking it is the are they literally being pinged by you are they going to the are they being pinned by your team are they going into the app is the app you know somewhere is the app part of that into into EMR what's the actual function they're

clicking on to go see this yeah so again it it is a little bit dependent on the patient and where they're wanting to receive their information right so is it in the app or do they want a phone call um but we are you know um very polite and kind but persistent so we'll we'll track them down um wherever they they are to see what support they need to you know to stay safe and adherent okay and for the a for the provider side where are they getting that are they also getting called they have the app do you

have a spart on fire app within their EMR what where's the uh where where are they getting the information right so where they're getting information is in that acknowledge um sort of uh section it's it's within the app itself you that doesn't doesn't come em workflow have you gone down the path of trying to put it in the EMR workflow or is that too complicated at this stage or have you not had a demand for that I'm just wondering you know I'm trying to figure out how you make it uh or these patients

are they been bugged enough about these patients they're okay going to another app and and and managing that process we're we're having there's a lot of discussions obviously about how you reduce fat app fatigue and whatever for for uh for individual providers yeah so I mean certainly that interaction with EMR um can be there what what we predominantly find Is that real time um so we're we're we're um you know pulling in or calling for whether it's Labs or Imaging or appointments on

a real-time basis and that's very important as related to RS and so um that's an aspect that isn't as well um the timeliness of that is a little bit um you know slower on the EMR side so what what we find is the htps really appreciate the like the immediacy and that they get to um set the you know the controls over how um they're informed and who they delegate to around um around those out of bounds or out of range type of alerts but certainly it can integrate in that it's it's really

meant to be like a you know a safety net um a peace of mind um so let's talk a little B about the business um first off how do you uh now you've got both these sides and you can R them both um how how do you get you know how do you get the clinicians I mean somebody has a fancy new drug cost a lot of money they' been told by the FDA or whomever that they have to follow up with providers and patients and great here's a his rxpx to uh to solve the problem how do you get doctors and patients on the system what's the actual

mechanics of doing of of of getting sign up and use it for sure so we most often go to market with our customers so whether that is you know through they may have an existing PSP if it's in advance um of coming to Market we have both um above brand and branded versions so where we're trying to build up um let's say education awareness um even patient acquisition we can do that um but then in terms of go to market we're really looking at where ises that hcp on board and we go to market with the with our

customers predominantly on on the Pharma side so literally if I have a new drug or this specialy Pharmacy is going out and talking to you know patients uh physicians in that specialty they'll say by the way you know if you're going to prescribe XYZ new new new new type of drug also here's this thing that you here's this service that goes along with it that you can take advantage how to monitor those patients and you know it's a freebie for you and and way and Away you go and the justification I assume

from the farmer end is a they've been told by regulation they've got to collect this data so great way of doing it cheaper and easier and B presumably um and you can tell me if you have data on this it increases adherence I would uh presumably sells more drugs in the end well I mean most importantly it increase adherence so the maximum benefit of that therapy can can be realized right so you know you can do both by the way you can do both you're absolutely right yeah you can hopefully hopefully if you take the drug as

indicated it works and therefore you sell more and make the patient better that is the idea yeah it is exactly the idea and we want you know we want everyone to have the maximum benefit of course of taking that therapy but um you know on on the when it's a Rems program and you know we're bringing in that Rems information and we're we're bringing in the mention before can you tell us what Rems is for those who don't know a risk evaluation um management strategy mitigation strategies so this is this is the thing

the FDA says you got to have this along with this drug just in case yeah okay that's great yeah so in order for the therapy to be subscribed you have to be enrolled and participating in a in a RS program and so um we will often integrate with that um and then again with the labs Imaging um the other aspects that need to be maintained all right and then uh how do you let's helicopter up um this is obviously com comprehensive offering um what type of patients do you Mo what type of patients do you mostly um talking about here I

assume there's a whole bunch of autoimmune and patients taking a lot of different therapies that that this is required for um how have you done both with those and what about patients who are in categories that look like that but don't have a Rems program attached to it is that something that's interest yeah yeah so you're you're right we do have a very deep um history and expertise in neurology um oncology um but we've done a lot in rare disease in in um card Cardiology and lifestyle and met cardio metabolic and

um we've got a list of about 16 now I guess Tas or therapeutic areas so the platform itself is agnostic um and we've had people using it for um C-section um for pre and post-operative arthroplasty um so the platform itself is agnostic but we do have quite an expertise um you know my co-founders are all in the neurology are either neurologists or or specialists in that area so you know that's our our where we sort of started Ed from that certainly we're across pretty much all Tas um that I can that I

can think of okay and then in terms of you know getting in front of the end client the Pharma company or the clinical research organization which I assume is another place it works well for you know uh what's what is your strategy Str what has been your strategy there and you know how do how do how do you how do you keep the company in this back to the business side how do you keep the company growing in in terms of building those relationships with building those relationships and you know what's the

level of uh basic sales required in that area right well we have msas in place with with most major farma around the world and so you know in some instances we've been partners for a long time and we're just continuing to bring the technology Evolution to them um in others I mean when it's brand new um there is usually a safety or adherance aspect that they're needing or or um patient acquisition um aspect and so um you know we have all the privacy and Regulatory compliant you know we've got

a our isos and our you know Hippa Pita and gdpr and our dpos and you know you name it we've got it and so it's really been built for life sciences and and where um you know sometimes that's really hard and certainly in our early days um you know going through all of those regulatory aspects as an early stage company is really challenging but certainly you know as we've matured having all of that in the background gives everyone a lot of um security around um we have all the checks and balances in place including you know PV

and Adverse Events Etc yeah I think that the you know the the story of small tech company with clever thing going to big farma company or big Health Plan and sort of getting stuck in the queue in the pilot and up taking it off and you know is is is always is a is a very common one and to get above that bridge a by spending all that time effort and Money Getting sort of certified for all that stuff you have to get through to to S of get on the MSA to spend all the effort to get on the vendor list and figure out how you

get bu how you build them and you know I I won't tell you the story of how I try to get be to pay their pay their exhibit uh their sponsorship fee for 20 14 15 16 for health du Europe the gation get to go just to get paid for something they already done they already they already got you let alone and that's for exhibits doesn't involve patients or yeah that but but but you know that's a significant thing but it's it's a that's a great thing but then once you get over that hump and you've got to

start offering them this service and if they if it seems to work it's part of the furniture that's a great that's a great business to be in so let talk so talking about the business let's go to sort of what happened to you so as you said these two organizations came came together and my understanding is there's a there's a a PE firm called P Pema Capital so you must have been doing okay before to get a PE firm to noce but there was a PE firm called PM Capital that came together normally when they

put two relatively small companies together they fire all the management team and put their own person in somehow they fire all their management team and then put you back in Sobe if they got fired but how did you work that you both got a check from on the Mana job so uh explain explain your saliy uh Gesa moves your your Jiu-Jitsu there I always love talking to you Matthew um so I would say after our pivotal conversation um yeah I keep blaming me or crediting me I'm my bill for the 10% getting closer and

closer but you know we we had a number of um offers you know coming in and we were heads down I mean we're you know just focused on the mission right no patient alone and every doctor supported and we just focus focus on that but um when pamba came in um the value and and maybe that sounds you know uh a little bit Superfluous but their values aligned with ours so you know doing you know being able to have a a successful business that was making an impact in the world um and Pemba very much backs Founders right they're they have um they

use a metaphor of a sherpa and that they are alongside you as you're as you're making the journey and so as we got to know them more um it was just a really good fit and certainly as I got to know you know the founders and uh the brilliant you know um folks that developed the hcp part and the rxmx part it was just it was a really natural marriage like it was it was um on like one of those dates and it was like this actually because our you know our big second date is you know I I asked them all to come to this remote area and

spend you know three days basically strategizing and skiing and they did and we just didn't want the date to end right it just felt really really good and our values were aligned we're pointed in the same direction um we wanted to grow the business in the same way but I think fundamentally and most importantly we wanted to make a real impact um for patients and doctors well that's you know great great news and two and a half years later you're still happy and smiling about it and uh and speaking of somebody who whose business

got acquired two and a half years later wasn't always necessarily where you would hoped it would be so that's that's great news talking about that give me a rough equation for how much you've grown since those you know since that M it's been two and a half years now where the numbers have gone are you you 50% bigger five times the size you know how is it going and then the next question obviously I mean private equity and private Equity at some point there's a next step and and so what share of the

kind of available Market of people with rare diseases plus you know plus drugs H how how much bigger can you get in your current iteration before as you mentioned many of the same tools could go to many other disease States you know or you could go in you know there's a bunch of places you could go with these tools or go be part of somebody else or what have you where do you think the future of rxpx ends up so first off how much you grown second how much more can you grow and where do you think that that takes you yeah for sure um so we're

still a fairly small team but we went from you know um sort of 30 40 to about 80 now um and I think Sor was it 40 on both sides combined when you merged or 30 40 C ratio that ended up at 80 after post merger yeah like combined we're at about 80 and we've got um the team is in the US um in uh Canada and Australia we've got UK um folks as well so put you can put 25% tarist on all of your interactions from now on about our wonderful new president there's there's a lot of there's a lot of time zones we have to

balance there but I mean it it's a huge Advantage because we're we're also sort of 247 um and uh and I you know I just have so much love for the team that I work with around the world so you know we're we're still relatively um you know I think small size but we're technology in in in company really you know we're very much designed for Life Sciences but um we're very much technology and built you know built to scale so in terms of how much bigger we can get I you know we we really really are committed to this no

patient alone every doctor supported like I can't tell you how committed everyone on the team is there's no one who walks through our front door that isn't either hasn't had an experience or personal experience um that they they want to make change so really you know we we know um that this works we know that it helps doctors we know that it improves adherance we know that it does safety at scale in a way that is very personalized um and and uh and very efficient and so you know we really see

this becoming a standard standard of care it's it's um almost irresponsible for a patient to not have this type of support and for our overburdened and very overworked doctors not to have the support so you know in terms of how much bigger we you know we'd like this to be a standard of care around okay let me push how much how much sort of Revenue wise have you grown in the since since post merger and what's your guesstimate for how much bigger this can get in the same categories so trying to figure out

how well served this compliance adherence regulate you know uh uh safety regulation Market is for patients well I think from an end to end perspective it isn't very well served so I think it's it's a very large gap that we're filling because so in your board in your board meeting you you know I can come in and say Linda this should be five times bigger in five years and you'll go yes of course that's easy I'm just pushing you here about about where where this ends up yeah I mean we

we we really talk about it in terms of you know being a standard of care and this being in the in the hands of every patient and doctor but I think you know growing um you know like 50 25 to 50% per year is is really where we're we're focused but again we don't think of it this way Matthew and I know this is usual but we think about you know the number you know the number of therapeutic areas that we've helped the number of doctors number of patients but honestly the doing just what you're doing now without

necessarily going into I don't know sort of you know case management for Value based care or or wider groups this you know has got the potential for that level of growth you you know when near tapped out for you know just in terms of new drugs that are coming to the market or or drugs that you know you haven't served yet that you could serve oh absolutely yeah absolutely because you know those 2third of new therapies that are going to be approved being specialty is that's a very personalized um kind of

experience and there is going to be the safety aspect yeah I'm just doing a board job for them so that you know they can come and harass you at the next meeting and say okay we saw you on this podcast on the healthcare blog claing you in to grow 50% a year what thanks hey that's uh that's I I I refuse to believe this conversation was not happening in private so you I can make it maybe you bought maybe you just found the one private Equity company that just doesn't care about money maybe well you know I would argue I

would argue that we have like I just can't I can't say enough like good things about them but it's it's you know it's very are they are they a Canadian private Equity company by the way they are Global okay are the people you do with Canadian I'm just trying to figure just because that to no no um so predominantly um the Founders are um are are British um and the team um predominantly is in Australia um but then they have LP the British and the Americans will regard as being nice people British Australians regard as

being nice people ESP not to each other anyway very smart I'm I'm only I'm only teasing you about that but you know it's it's uh it's no it's it's super just seriously it is super great that you're you know I don't know what you say in private but in public you have such a uh you if you be half of nice about them in private as you are in public um that's great I've had so many you know people over the years who have run into private Equity who they thought were coming in

saying one thing and doing another you know and they've kicked out and by the way I've noticed it particularly with female Founders who you know bought into for they W to One Vision and found the the finance browers come along and push them out and what have you and you know it's it's great to hear that that's that's not the story and the fact you know that they a gave you the you know when they came in gave you a check gave you the job and B that you know you you're doing you're you're talking so

nicely about them in public um I think it's it's very encouraging because that is not the story often and you know there is obviously a big opportunity for what you're doing here you've got a great product you've got a great uh you know niche market but as we've been discussing in each market that is potentially huge and I think it's great that you can continue to you can continue to grow that um you know and as you mentioned help a hell of lot of patients because their life is you know

let's face it you see the drug company ads when people are frolicking in The Meadows and you know God knows you know fishing with their kids that's not the real world experience of the average person who's you know super sick with one of these uh you know one of these rare diseases and uh and it's great to great to see that you know the little help they can get as we know is the better so okay that's my uh my my my sermon lecture over um I've been talking with uh Linda Brown cancer she is the

CEO of rxp X coming from the merger of rxmx and curatio where she was the CEO um Linda thanks so much for your time really great catching up with you I will take all the credit for all your success because you you claim we had this drunken conversation at some conference back in 2022 or 21 whatever it was and maybe it was 2019 I thought I I I have no recollection of it at all so I think you probably you might have had this conversation with somebody else all right no no it's yeah but congratulations on the

success congratulations on what you're doing and it's good to see that somebody who's been plugging away this for so long is doing so well so uh Linda thanks for your time thank you it's always a pleasure and and thanks for you know all your good advice along the way okay bye now
