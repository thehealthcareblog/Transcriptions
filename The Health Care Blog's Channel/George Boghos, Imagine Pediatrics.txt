Matthew Hall TCB Spotlight and I have with with me with George BOS George is the uh CEO of Imagine Pediatrics which uh as you can tell from his T-shirt is spelled wrong but slightly but wrong but uh but uh is about uh he's been building for a while a company that has been uh doing a doing a virtual pediatric clinic for kids who have a lot of problems in general a lot of health problems uh particularly autism and some others so George uh tell me a little bit about the origins of the company um how you got into this and

what the problem is you're trying to solve yeah Matthew thank you for having me on first of all I really appreciate it uh yeah happy to tell you about what we're doing at imagin Pediatrics um so we are a an Innovative Tech enabled pediatrician L Medical Group group that provides 247 virtual and inhome care for children with special healthare needs when we talk about children with special Health Care needs we're talking about one out of every five kids in the United States there's about 14 million of them

but uh though they're one out of every five they account for 50% of our spend on Pediatrics as a country uh these are children with complex needs uh both medical social behavioral and mental health that often come together via a multitude of diagnoses and clinical conditions that make these children's heavy utilizers of the impatient setting the emergency room and frankly the the current Legacy system of Pediatrics is oftentimes not well suited to serve our most complex kits so what we're here to do at imagine today we're

a team of 300 uh clinicians serving about 30,000 children with special Healthcare needs um and we're here to improve their outcomes improve the quality of their care uh increase access and reduce their overall cost uh of of Health Care by reducing unnecessary utilization providing the right care for the right patient at the right time all right so you've then got a small well not a small group a a relatively small proportion of kids but expensive ones you mentioned have different types of problems G give me a

flavor obviously autism is the one that people think of as being a highly you know High High concentrated but very problematic issue for kids but give me a faor of the other types of conditions that kids have that you're dealing with yeah great question so uh the one thing that is common about the kids we're working with is no one child looks like the next uh they have a ton of complex and varying and heterogeneous needs just to give you a sense uh about 33% of the children working with are technology

dependent uh typically on a feeding tube or a ventil or a tracheotomy or a central line due to a variety of genetic or other clinical conditions um about 72% of our patients have a behavioral or mental health comorbidity you're right autism is a very common one uh but we're also dealing with things like stress anxiety ADHD uh depression uh some early mood disorders as well we deal with a variety of of cardio uh and neuro conditions about 20% of our patients have a neurod develop mental disorder uh uh about 50% of our patients

have some sort of durable medical equipment need that could be anything from feeding formula to special specialized equipments they need for their disorders uh we have kids that are dealing with malignancy or cancer uh as well so it's a variety of conditions Matthew um on average our children have three Chic conditions typically so it's a combination of everything I just threw out it's uh generally one me one at least one mental health condition with uh a lot of other medical needs that again just just make these children very

complex to manage um and they have a ton of needs where a pediatrician office by itself is not able to serve all the complex needs that they have so give me the sort of before and after contrast I'm a family and I have a kid who has some you know complex set of problems like this what have I usually been dealing with and then when I go and work when I go and work with imagine what happens you know what's the differ difference yeah so um again some kids have more resources than others uh the beauty of our model is today we're in

Texas we're in Florida and we're in the district of Colombia and we serve border to border in all those territories so we've got kids in rural geographies kids in urban geographies that have more or less access to resources but typically on average kids might have a pediatrician that they go to uh but the pediatrician is not uh available 24/7 they're not able to offer uh let's say mental health support uh and resources they're not able to extend into the home and so while you're able to go to the

pediatrition office during the day what's missing is what happens at two in the morning if uh if a child has a feeding tube and the feeding tube falls out uh typically that parents going to the emergency department and they're uh waiting at the Ed to be seen uh sometimes those emergency department visits turn into lengthy costly hospital stays uh for those children and so with imagine Pediatrics via our Tech enabled model uh our our parents have an app on their phone they download the app uh we are our team of clinicians made of

doctors nurse practitioners uh nurses pharmacists dietitians therapists social workers all come together to talk with these families on a daily weekly basis and more importantly we're available 247 virtually and in the home so in that instance where an emergency happens at 2 in the morning with a feeding tube rather than go to the emergency room you're able to get uh on video with a pediatrician within minutes uh and we're able to potentially send somebody into your home to prevent that emergency

situation that again could lead to a very unnecessary inconvenient Hospital State for the family so um uh two things first off does this replace their current pediatrician or they augment their current pediatrician and the second question is how do you I mean I get the the tell Health part Hospital you know Care at home obviously there a lot of work around hospital at home and remote monitoring all that stuff these days but how do you manage the in the home part you just that you just mentioned so fantastic question so uh

first no we do not replace the pediatrician or any other existing healthc care provider think of us as a wraparound layer uh we're there to bring all of the various um care plans and resources together in one place where there to fill the gaps and we're really there to work alongside the existing care ecosystem right um some of our families are seeing five to 10 different providers or Specialists uh they might have a a home care nurse they have a pediatrician they might be going to school and so they've got a lot of

resources but they're often disjointed not connected and so what we're there to do is bring all of that together and so a lot of what we've invested in in our technology as well is how do we communicate by Direction with the existing ecosystem of healthcare providers right if we see somebody in the middle of the night for an emergency we are communicating with the pediatrician the next morning to let them know what happened and what we did uh so we're there really as an extension of the existing care care

ecosystem so um this takes me in in two directions the first one is the ongoing problem of you know care coordination forget T Health forget wrap around care is a massive problem right right so uh are you how are you dealing with that in terms of data transfer how are you dealing with that in terms of of actual care coordination with those different players if it's five or six different Specialists and maybe a children's hospital they're also seeing or what have you um uh yeah what is the function

that do you regard yourselves as the care coordinator and the quarterback of that care are do you just are you on the peripheries of that where do you see your role instead of being the uh you know the The Advocate the care Navigator it wor for that kid yeah um so so the answer is we play we're able to play a more or less active role for each patient depending on what existing resources they have so some patients have a true quarterback being a specialist or a PCP that's stepping in and taken the primary role and there

were more of an extension of what they're doing uh some other patients might not have an established relationship with a PCP and there we're stepping in and taking more of a primary role but what doesn't change in either case is we've invested a a lot into Data Integrations with all of our partners be at PCP offices be at hospitals be at Specialists it's both data interchanges bidirectionally so we're plugged into health information exchanges and other systems where we're sending our data to

the system but we're also getting data back so we know exactly what's going on in that patients care Journey uh and then we're also establishing on the ground relationships with PCP offices in the state of Texas uh we've got relationships with over 2,000 uh PCP practices uh pediatric groups across the state where we've got shared patients and we're going in we're meeting with those pediatricians we're talking to them face to face so it's not just the data Matthew it's it's the data plus the

personal relationship with the other um folks in the care ecosystem for those kids to make sure that we're providing a seamless Journey for these patients um they're already sometimes inundated with a lot of information and a ton of resources and the last thing we want to do is complicate things further our job should be to to to make it seamless and make sure that we're bringing uh all of the folks in the care ecosystem together uh for the benefit of the patient um and then the bit we didn't go go back to but

let's go back to before we dive into the the business a bit more which is the how do you manage the on the ground piece how many if I'm a if I'm a family and I have a kid and theyve got a feeding tube they got some other issue they need DME or whatever um what what happens what happens in general you know if I need a new whatever the thing piece of equipment but if it's 2: in the morning and someone has to come in and help how how how do you organize that part fantastic question so um what happens

generally in an emergency situation in the home is truly you're you're you're typically going to the emergency room or to an urgent care center so you're getting in the car and physically taking your child somewhere which might not sound that complicated but it often is for our families given the complexity of the children we're uh we're serving and so what we're able to do is in that instance they're able to fire up their imagin Pediatrics app on their phone uh they're able to message us we can hop on

a video visit within typically a minute or two with one of our pediatrician and if we can't work through the emergency virtually we can dispatch one of our trained paramedics uh that are able to go into the home uh the paramedics are able to provide uh you know Hands-On support in the home via diagnostic testing they're able to do lab draws they're able to deal with an emergency situation and they're always supported via video by our pediatrician and so we've got you know always a pediatrician

present we've got folks in the home dealing with an emergency situation as well so oftentimes think of it as you know preventing a trip to an urgent care when it can be prevented a lot of times it cannot and we'll we'll tell them to get in the car and go to the emergency room uh that's just the reality but oftentimes we're able to step in and and provide a much more um high quality quity convenient visit for that family and are those your paramedics or do you have a relationship with other different

paramedic organizations there ours so we you know imagine employees our entire multi-disciplinary team of clinicians as I mentioned they're always led by complex care uh board certified pediatricians but supported by um advanced practice providers supported by nurses social workers um we've got Pharmacy we've got uh dietitians we've got therapists and then our paramedics so they all work seamlessly within care teams really the idea is to build long-term relationships with our patients to really establish trust with

these families um so they're they're reaching out to us in their moments of highest needs and and we're there to deliver you know the right care for the right patient at the right time but but you also have you know people are physically on the ground who are driving around and I see there's some place in Texas that take a while to get to but I don't comp back yeah yeah so we've got uh so in a lot of a lot of cases in in the you know dense Metro areas we employ our own paramedics some

places you're right we can't get to every corner of Texas so we do partner with other providers where they become an extension of what we do but that's that's in those kind of remote areas that we're not able to reach ourselves right okay so let's talk about the uh the the the the function as a business I assume the basic uh conversation is you go to a health plan I know you you set up with a few health plans in Texas and and you mentioned uh sorry the other state is DC and what's

Florida yeah um I assume you set up with a few Heal Points I assume the conversations you sharp and say if you know you were the very sick kids with multiple chronic conditions who tend out High Health costs you know you work with the manic Pediatrics you pay us and you'll pay the you'll pay the hospitals SL emergency room/ urgent care people a lot less for a kid um so tell me a bit about how that conversation goes and what data you have to show so far that that uh that makes up because at some point you to get this started and

someone had to take a leap of faith I mean it sounds like better medicine sounds like a better experience for the for the for the kids and for the for the parents but uh for the families but um you know on the other hand that doesn't just because you bring that along doesn't mean necessarily that Health Plans will pay for it so how tell me S tell me give me the business case for why you do this and and what proof points you have yeah fantastic question we're proud to have some the proof points we're uh we're three years into

of our journey so we're starting to see some really awesome results of the model But to answer your question uh we do go we do partner with health plans uh we go in we look at a specific part of their pediatric population again typically the highest Acuity costliest part of the Pediatric population that uh where we can come in and and make a difference uh and provide better care holistically 247 virtually and in the home uh and once that population attributed to us we are a full value based care model so um so

the the imagine's economic model is we are looking to bend the cost curve we are looking to provide better care uh in lower cost settings we're looking to prevent uh unnecessary utilization of the emergency room in the hospital uh and we're looking to you know when kids going into the hospital discharge them uh often times sooner uh in a better experience and reduce cost there and so far we're proud that the model is shown amazing results um so uh today what we've shown is uh kids who work with

imagine Pediatrics experience a 31% reduction in the number of inpatient hospital stays relative to uh you know prior to imagine Pediatrics and then that translates to about a 9% reduction in their total cost of care that is everything they spent on Healthcare we're able to reduce by 9% again primarily just by providing the right level of care at the right time uh to the right patient and reducing that unnecessary utilization and are you getting paid sort of a flat fee and then offering you know the savings come to

the health plan or are you in are you at risk for delivering on those numbers we are at risk so we we put we put our money where our mouth is and that's the beauty of our model is we bring the clinical care and the technology um to provide to provide the right care for those kids and if we're able to improve outcomes that is that is our model so we share the risk uh up and down with our health plan partners and so we really mean what we say and we believe in our model that it works and and we're super

proud that it's it's showing really good results so far um so let's talk a bit about uh you know the F the founding of from the founding of the company raising money um you're in uh you know two and a half States I don't know if you call DCS State these days but our concentrated you know a lot of people in concentrated their urban area um then as you meant you said you said one in five kids fits into this category sounds like a lot I assume I assume there is actually probably like you know

that's 20% but maybe there's two to 5% who are the super expensive ones I know what the coverage is but I mean uh give me a sense for how big you are within those current States and what your plans are to grow into other states and to grow the grow the model as a whole and how big can this get yeah fantastic question so uh you are correct one and five children have special Health Care needs but that is a long spectrum of anything from a child who might have severe asthma or we can step in and help to all the way to the

very complex skids that we've talked about that might be technology dependent and have multiple you know chronic conditions and so we look at the whole uh ecosystem and today as I mentioned we're serving about 30,000 kids uh in those geographies you discussed and we're blessed to be partnered with some some awesome Innovative Health Plans across those three geographies and we're looking to expand uh into other areas where we can be helpful so we're looking at a few additional states that we're

hoping to be in you know this year uh in in 2025 to serve uh a lot more children there and then we're looking to continue to expand and grow within our existing States so partnering with additional healthc care um health plans that we're not working with today uh to serve to serve more kids but our our our plans are that you know every child with special Healthcare needs toer deserves uh access to the right level of care and uh really good highquality care wherever they are and and our hope to be able to

reach you know more and more kids as as the company matures so give me a sense about how how I mean you've got a number of Health finds I know in in uh in in Florida and and Texas but they're not the ones that we think as being the big health plans in those States in general in general I me that may that may be unfair uh you you tell me if I'm wrong but my but but uh you know for the big blues or the big National plans if you were to move you know just within Texas and Florida how many kids roughly do you think are you

know are how many more kids do you think you could easily put onto this system within those States yeah so easily in the states we're in easily five to seven times as many kids as we're serving today just in Texas and Florida so so you you you could get a 150,000 from the 30,000 for sure obviously obviously you there are many other things so is the do you think the best best way for the company to expand is is in those current states and adding a few States at a time I mean and and at what point um I mean

you know you're going to have to scale up as you go but but at what point you know do you think do you think you're going to need you're going to run into sort of issues with scale and distance and and Staffing it can't be can't be easy with that so I'm trying to think in your next couple of you know when you think about expanding how are you thinking about doing it yeah that's right so um we've got a few stat so we are partnered with some of the large national health plans and we're

privileged that they you know plans that we're with in Texas and in Florida have needs for us uh an interest of us to be in other states and so we're looking at a few additional States so it's going to be both Matthew it's going to be going into states where um you know our health plans are taking us where we could be helpful in reaching more children at the same time we do see a lot of value that were established in places like Texas I mentioned we've got you know a significant number of children in the

state of Texas uh we've got as you mentioned we've got boots on the ground in terms of paramedics so there is benefit in having density in a single state for us uh we've spent a ton of effort developing relationships with the local healthc care players uh in a place like Texas uh via the PCP offices or the hospitals so there's a huge value in continuing to expand in our current markets and and reach more and more kids via additional he plan Partnerships so it's going to be a lot of that going

deep uh into our few States we're also looking opportunistically at like I said two to three additional States this year where we've got interest from Health Plan Partners um to expand beyond the three geographies we're in and then tell me about that I mean I mentioned Staffing as one of the issues uh everyone complains about lack of Staff or across Healthcare um have you f where you know how much capacity do you have with the current you said you mentioned think 300 clinicians you're working with

now how much capacity do you currently have now to sort of fill them up versus how much how many how many more do you think you're going to need to hire and tell me about what you're finding in the market in terms of the uh availability of the right kind of people fantastic question yeah we're we're not immune to Staffing challenges in healthcare uh certainly not uh what we do find so so to answer your question you know our our team is able to support uh you know the approximately 30,000 kids that we've got

today and then U some additional as we bring on you know more kids onto the platform but as we grow we're going to need to continue to add uh to our clinical teams and and so far what we've experienced Matthew is our value proposition to the clinicians is really resonating specifically the fact that this is a value based care model which is U you know somewhat rare in Pediatrics and it's a model that allows clinicians be it nurses or pediatricians to really establish very deep longitudinal year yearslong

relationships with these families uh so a lot of our our teammates come from the hospital setting and that's just a very different type of working environment it's a very different relationship with the families that you're forming bside versus the opportunity to to uh really you know do healthc care the way it should be done form very very deep yearslong relationships with these families and so we're finding that our our value proposition just the way it's resonating with health plans and with

patients it's resonating just as well with clinicians and so knock on wood uh so far we've had we've had great success attracting teammates uh and and and clinicians to our mission and obviously hope uh for that to continue to be the case as we expand to new geographies so uh two final questions for you one's about sort of infrastructure um you obviously we talked a lot about clinicians and staring and and people on the ground and what what in terms of how you have created the infrastructure for doing the

app the tella Health the uh um and and and the process and the and the exchange did you build your own system you using somebody using a combination of others just how have you thought about that yeah um so we we have built our own systems so we've got our own proprietary Tech stack that we've developed it's uh starts first and foremost with our patient facing app that's really the heartbeat of everything that we do it's on the devices of our of our caregivers um and on our patients and that's how we

deliver a lot of the care that we do it's backed up by our proprietary um uh you population Health Care Management tool that are clinicians use internally uh to do things like triage the right care for the right patient to document everything to make sure we're we're doing really good population Health Management for our cohort uh and then it's all backed up by a data warehouse that we've invested a ton in so we draw on a lot of data resources we're plugged into health information exchanges we get

real time data on utilization from across the healthcare ecosystem that our that our kids and patients are accessing with that let's just do Matthew is really personalized the the the care Journey for each patient uh so knowing who should get what type of uh touch point from what type of clinician and what is the right intervention to provide for these kids as I mentioned it's a very heterogeneous population so we spent a ton of time starting to develop some Predictive Analytics and some really cool work we're able to do

with just the breadth of data we have to take that and turn it into actionable insights uh for our clinicians as they're delivering the care so uh We've chosen to build it or ourselves because a it's you know it's a huge part of what what we do and so we want full ability to customize and and and drive it and integrate it into our clinical workflows uh and then you know secondarily uh it's pediatric so it's a very specialized use case uh there's not a ton out there in terms of solutions tailor made for a

pediatric population so we've gone that way um we do integrate with some additional so we use an EMR that's um you know that's a large well-known EMR that we have not built that part of it on our own but really the basis of the tech stack we've chosen uh to invest heavily in in our first couple years yeah and I think that's as you said Pediatrics there's probably has somebody hasn't built thing you could buil by off the shelf so you probably customizing a bunch of other stuff even if you were

you know go going going down that path give them give them what you're doing all right um let's uh close with the company uh you've raised some money how much from whom and uh give me a flavor of where where the business where the business is you know in that sort of fundraising cycle I assume all the stuff you just talked about wasn't cheap and free and you're probably not not make you radically a huge profit at the moment but tell tell me about tell me about the business part of it yeah so uh

we're blessed to be backed by some really awesome in Innovative uh investors within Healthcare uh today we've got Rubik account Founders uh as as an as an investor and early backer of ours as well as Oak HC CFT and optim Ventures and they have all been amazing partners for us as we brought the idea of Imagine Pediatrics from you know an idea in a room with a few people into a full company that's serving uh today 30,000 kids uh with with 300 folks and so they've been really supportive of ours funding the business but more

importantly just providing the right um the right resources and tools and being great soundboard for us as we built imagine and how much do you ra so far so it's been about uh it's been about $25 million so far um that that we've raised and then we we would look to raise some additional Capital down the road uh as we continue to expand into into new States as well and what's your sense about how about if there's a both sort of a possibility but all possibility but also the ease of creating a nationwide pediatric uh uh

practice on the model you've got now um you mentioned a couple more stes next year but I mean you know it's a big big country a lot of people in a lot of different places uh you know do you do you think there is medical groups physical medical groups haven't spread very well yeah virtual medical groups have got have got U regulatory issues spreading but I mean do you think that's the ultimate goal that is our ultimate goal uh our ultimate vision is every child with special Health Care needs deserves the kind of care that we're

able to provide multi-disciplinary high value care that that just makes the lives of theid and their caregivers a lot better so our hope is to continue expanding we got to do that thoughtfully we got to make sure we're we're building the right infrastructure to support scaling as you mentioned Matthew making sure that we continue to keep um you know quality and patient safety and well-being at the Forefront of everything we do uh so we got to be careful and measured with it but our hope certainly is to continue

expanding and bringing imagin pediat tricks to uh to many more kids down the road fantastic I'm speak with George bogos he is the CEO of imagine Pediatrics I said it was spelled wrong because uh start because it's actually spelled right and normally these days people spell something with a weird put two e in or something strange but no it's spel as you can imagine it and they're doing amazing work in putting together as you said a sort of rle rounds suround support uh P pediatric experience for some very sick kids who

let's face it need a lot of help George thanks for your time great to get great to get to know your company a little bit thank you Matthew appreciate the opportunity
